* CH01 802.11 Overview
** OSI model
    OSI模型是数据通信的基石，它包含如下几层：
    + Layer 7: Application
    + Layer 6: Presentation
    + Layer 5: Session
    + Layer 4: Transport
    + Layer 3: Network
    + Layer 2: Data-Link
      - LLC sublayer
      - MAC sublayer
    + Layer 1: Physical

** Packets, frames, and bits

    对于802.11通信来说，最主要的目标是将用户数据从一台计算设备传输到另
    一台。

    数据从OSI模型上的一层层传下来，最终到达物理层。在物理层是以比特位
    形式呈现的。二进制数字是数字通信的基础。一个字节的信息包含8个比特
    位。

** Data-Link layer
    
    802.11数据链路层分为两个子层：
    - 处于上层的是802.11逻辑链路控制层，跟所有其他的802网络一样。
    - 处于上层的是媒体访问控制子层。802.11标准定义了MAC子层的操作。MAC
      子层是下层物理层与逻辑链路控制层之间的接口。

*** MSDU
    
       当网络层的数据发往数据链路层，数据被传送给逻辑链路子层，称为MAC
       Service Data Unit (MSDU). MSDU包含IP数据包以及一些LLC层数据。

       802.11 2007规范中指出MSDU最大的大小为2304字节。The maximum
       frame body size is determined by the maximum MSDU size (2,304
       octets) plus any overhead from encryption. 
    
*** MPDU

       当LLC将数据发往MAC层，会添加一些MAC头部信息到MSDU，封装成为MAC
       Protocol Data Unit (MPDU). MPDU就是一个802.11帧。

** Physical layer

    物理层也分为两层： Physical Layer Convergence Procedure (PLCP) 和
    Physical Medium Dependent (PMD). PLCP层从MAC拿到数据，为数据传输做
    准备，数据打包为PLCP Protocol Data Unit (PPDU)。PMD层进行调制并将
    数据按比特位进行传输。

*** PSDU

     都是指802.11帧，只不过是从物理层的视角看待的。

*** PPDU

    PLCP添加了一些前导码和物理层头部信息给PSDU。 前导码用于传输方与接
    收方之间的同步。当PPDU创建完后，PMD将拿去传输。

** 802.11 architecture

    - distribution system (DS)
      A system used to interconnect a set of basic service sets and
      integrated local area networks (LANs) to create an extended
      service set (ESS).
    - distribution system medium (DSM)
      The logical physical medium used by a distribution system for
      communications between access points and portals of an extended
      service set. In most cases, the DSM is an 802.3 Ethernet LAN.

** 802.11 services

*** Station service

    - Authentication
    - Deauthentication
    - Data confidentiality ( NN encryption)
    - MSDU delivery
    - Dynamic frequency selection (DFS)
    - Transmit power control (TPC)
    - Higher-layer timer synchronization (QoS facility only)
    - QoS traffic scheduling (QoS facility only)

*** Distribution system service

    - Association
    - Reassociation
    - Disassociation
    - Distribution
    - Integration
    - QoS traffic scheduling (QoS facility only)

     Integration Service is a frame format transfer method.

** 802.11 frames

*** Management frames

    Management frames are used by wireless stations to join and leave
    the basic service set.
    
    Another name for an 802.11 management frame is a Management MAC
    Protocol Data Unit (MMPDU).

    There is no MSDU encapsulated in the MMPDU frame body, which
    carries only layer 2 information fields and information elements.

    The following is a list of all 12 management frame subtypes as
    defined by the 802.11-2007 standard: 
    - Association request
    - Association response
    - Reassociation request
    - Reassociation response
    - Probe request
    - Probe response
    - Beacon
    - Announcement traffic indication message (ATIM)
    - Disassociation
    - Authentication
    - Deauthentication
    - Action

*** Control frames

    802.11 control frames assist with the delivery of the data frames.

    The following is a list of all eight control frame subtypes as
    defined by the 802.11 standard: 
    - Power Save Poll (PS-Poll)
    - Request to send (RTS)
    - Clear to send (CTS)
    - Acknowledgment (ACK)
    - Contention Free-End (CF-End)
    - CF-End + CF+ACK
    - Block ACK Request (BlockAckReq)
    - Block ACK (BlockAck)

*** Data frames

    Any data frames that do not carry a MSDU payload are not encrypted
    because a layer 3–7 data payload does not exist. 

    The following is a list of all 15 data frame subtypes as defined
    by the 802.11 standard: 
    - Data (simple data frame)
    - Null function (no MSDU payload)
    - Data + CF-ACK
    - Data + CF-Poll
    - Data + CF-ACK + CF-Poll
    - CF-ACK (no MSDU payload)
    - CF-Poll (no MSDU payload)
    - CF-ACK + CF-Poll (no MSDU payload)
    - QoS data
    - QoS Null (no MSDU payload)
    - QoS data + CF-ACK
    - QoS data + CF-Poll
    - QoS data + CF-ACK + CF-Poll
    - QoS CF-Poll (no MSDU payload)
    - QoS CF-ACK + CF-Poll (no MSDU payload)

** IEEE 802.11-2007 standard and amendments

    The Wi-Fi Alliance’s main task is to ensure the interoperability
    of WLAN products by providing certification testing. 

** Review Questions
    
    1. The information found inside an IP packet is considered the
       main payload for which of the following?

       A. MPDU

       B. PPDU

       C. PSDU

       D. MSDU

       E. MMPDU

       *答案解析*

       D. An IP packet comprises layer 3–7 information. The MAC
       Service Data Unit (MSDU) contains data from the LLC sublayer
       and/or any number of layers above the Data-Link layer. The MSDU
       is the payload found inside the body of 802.11 data frames. 

    2. Which sublayer of the OSI model’s Data-Link layer is used for
       communication between 802.11 radios?

       A. LLC

       B. WPA

       C. MAC

       D. FSK

       *答案解析*

       C. The IEEE 802.11-2007 standard defines communication
       mechanisms at only the Physical layer and the MAC sublayer of
       the Data-Link layer of the OSI model. The Logical Link Control
       (LLC) sublayer of the Data-Link layer is not defined by the
       802.11-2007 standard. WPA is a security certification. FSK is a
       modulation method. 

    3. Which of the following contains the same information found with
       an MPDU?

       A. APDU

       B. PPDU

       C. PSDU

       D. MSDU

       *答案解析*

       C. The Data-Link layer refers to an 802.11 frame as the MPDU,
       while the Physical layer refers to this same 802.11 frame as
       the PLCP Service Data Unit (PSDU). 

    4. What are the three main components of an 802.11 MPDU? (Choose
       the three best answers.)

       A. Frame body

       B. PPDU

       C. MSDU

       D. Trailer

       E. MAC header

       *答案解析*

       A, D, E. The 802.11 frame contains a layer 2 MAC header, a
       variable-length frame body, and a trailer, which is a 32-bit
       CRC known as the frame check sequence (FCS). The frame body
       contains the MSDU. The PPDU consists of a PSDU, preamble, and
       PHY header. 

    5. Which 802.11 frames are usually encrypted for data privacy
       reasons?

       A. Management frames

       B. Control frames

       C. QoS data frames with MSDU payload

       D. Data frames without an MSDU payload

       E. MMPDU

       *答案解析*

       C. Most 802.11 data frames and QoS data frames carry the actual
       MSDU data that is passed down from the higher-layer
       protocols. The layer 3–7 MSDU payload is normally encrypted for
       data privacy reasons. However, some 802.11 data frames carry no
       MSDU payload at all but do have a specific MAC control purpose
       within a basic service set (BSS). Any data frames that do not
       carry an MSDU payload are not encrypted because a layer 3–7
       data payload does not exist. Management frames do not carry any
       upper-layer information. 802.11 management frames have no MSDU
       encapsulated in the MMPDU frame body, which carries only layer
       2 information fields and information elements. 802.11 control
       frames contain only header information and a trailer. Control
       frames do not have a frame body. 

    6. Which OSI sublayer is responsible for modulation and
       transmission of data bits?

       A. PLCP

       B. PPTP

       C. MAC

       D. LLC

       E. PMD

       *答案解析*

       E. The PLCP and PMD are sublayers of layer 1, the Physical
       layer. The PLCP sublayer adds a preamble and PHY header to the
       PSDU to create a PPDU. The preamble is used for synchronization
       between transmitting and receiving 802.11 radios. After the
       PPDU is created, the PMD sublayer takes the PPDU and modulates
       the data bits and begins transmitting. The LLC and MAC are
       sublayers of the layer 2 Data-Link layer. 

    7. In what type of WLAN devices can the distribution system
       services (DSSs) operate? (Choose all that apply.)

       A. Mesh Access point

       B. WLAN controller

       C. Autonomous access point

       D. Laptop client radio

       E. VoWiFi phone

       *答案解析*

       A, B, C. The IEEE does not define the specifics of DS
       implementation; the architecture that uses the distribution
       system services (DSSs) can be used by different types of WLAN
       architecture including access points and WLAN
       controllers. Client STAs do not use any of the services of DSS
       and only use the capabilities of the 802.11 defined station
       service (SS). 

    8. Which service of the DSS is responsible for the transfer of
       upper layer 3–7 information from an 802.11 frame format to an
       802.3 frame format? 
       
       A. Association

       B. Integration

       C. Reassociation

       D. Disassociation

       E. QoS traffic scheduling

       *答案解析*

       B. All the options are considered distribution system services
       (DSSs). The integration service (IS) enables delivery of MSDUs
       between the distribution system (DS) and a non-IEEE-802.11
       local area network (LAN), via a portal. A simpler way of
       defining the integration service is to characterize it as a
       frame format transfer method. The portal is usually either an
       access point or a WLAN controller. The payload of a wireless
       802.11 data frame is the upper layer 3–7 information known as
       the MSDU. The eventual destination of this payload usually
       resides on a wired network infrastructure. Because the wired
       infrastructure is a different physical medium, an 802.11 data
       frame payload (MSDU) must be effectively transferred into an
       802.3 Ethernet frame. 

    9. Which of these services can be characterized by the 802.11
       station service (SS)? (Choose all that apply.)

       A. Association

       B. Authentication

       C. Disassociation

       D. Deauthentication

       E. Transmit power control

       *答案解析*

       B, D, E. Authentication, deauthentication, data confidentiality
       (encryption), MSDU delivery, dynamic frequency selection (DFS),
       transmit power control (TPC), higher layer timer
       synchronization (QoS facility only), and QoS traffic scheduling
       (QoS facility only) are all considered to be station services
       that are provided at the MAC sublayer. Association and
       disassociation are services that also operate at the MAC
       sublayer; however, they are classified as distribution system
       services. 

    10. Which of these 802.11 frames carry a MAC sublayer payload
        inside the frame body? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. Beacon

        B. Data frame

        C. Reassociation request

        D. QoS data frame

        E. Probe response

        F. PS-Poll

        *答案解析*

        A, C, E. Beacon, reassociation request, and probe response
        frames are all 802.11 management frames. Management frames
        have a MAC header, a frame body, and a trailer; however,
        management frames do not carry any upper-layer
        information. There is no MSDU encapsulated in the MMPDU frame
        body, which carries only layer 2 information fields and
        information elements. A PS-Poll frame is an 802.11 control
        frame. Control frames do not have a frame body. Data and QoS
        data frames are MPDUs whose frame body contains an MSDU
        upper-layer 3–7 payload. 

    11. In what type of WLAN devices can the stations service (SS)
        operate? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. Mesh access point

        B. WLAN controller

        C. Autonomous access point

        D. Laptop client radio

        E. VoWiFi phone

        *答案解析*

        A, B, C, D, E. The station service (SS) is used by all 802.11
        client stations including APs. Access points also use station
        services because they also have STA functionality. The
        majority of WLAN controller vendors implement what is known as
        a split MAC architecture. With this type of WLAN architecture,
        some of the MAC services are handled by the WLAN controller,
        and some are handled by the controller-based access
        point. Therefore, the 802.11 station MAC services such as data
        privacy (encryption) are used by client STAs and other WLAN
        architecture. However, the distribution system MAC services
        such as the integration service do not operate with client STAs.

    12. The IEEE 802.11-2007 standard defines communication mechanisms
        at which layers of the OSI model? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. Network

        B. Physical

        C. Transport

        D. Application

        E. Data-Link

        F. Session

        *答案解析*

        B, E. The IEEE 802.11-2007 standard only defines communication
        mechanisms at the Physical layer and MAC sublayer of the
        Data-Link layer of the OSI model. 

    13. Which OSI sublayer is responsible for adding a preamble and
        PHY header to an MPDU?

        A. PLCP

        B. PPTP

        C. MAC

        D. LLC

        E. PMD

        *答案解析*

        A. The MAC layer refers to an 802.11 frame as the MPDU, while
        the Physical layer refers to this same exact 802.11 frame as
        the PSDU. The PLCP and PMD are sublayers of layer 1, the
        Physical layer. The PLCP sublayer adds a preamble and PHY
        header to the PSDU to create a PPDU. The preamble is used for
        synchronization between transmitting and receiving 802.11
        radios. After the PPDU is created, the PMD sublayer takes the
        PPDU, modulates the data bits, and begins transmitting. The
        LLC and MAC are sublayers of the layer 2 Data-Link layer.

    14. Which of the following frequency spaces are supported by HT
        clause 20 radios? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. UNII 5.15–5.25 GHz

        B. UNII 5.25–5.35 GHz

        C. UNII 5.47–5.715 GHz

        D. UNII 5.725–5.825 GHz

        E. ISM 2.4–2.4835 GHz

        *答案解析*

        A, B, C, D, E. The 802.11n devices (HT clause 20) support the
        4 UNII bands (UNII-1, UNII-2, UNII-3, and UNII-2 Extended).

    15. Which of the following devices are classified as 802.11 STA
        devices? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. Autonomous AP

        B. VoWiFi Telephone

        C. Cellular Telephone

        D. DSSS Barcode Scanner

        *答案解析*

        A, B, D. The 802.11-2007 standard defines a station (STA) as
        any device that contains 802.11-compliant MAC and PHY
        interface to the wireless medium (WM). Although access points
        are typically specifically referred to as APs, since they
        contain an 802.11-compliant MAC and PHY interface to the
        wireless medium, they are technically stations, albeit a
        special type of station. Cellular telephones do not use 802.11
        standards. 

    16. Which Wi-Fi Alliance certification validates many of the
        robust security network (RSN) Which Wi-Fi Alliance
        certification validates many of the robust security network
        (RSN) apply.)

        A. WMM

        B. CWG-RF

        C. 802.11k

        D. WMM-PS

        E. WPA2

        *答案解析*

        E. The Wi-Fi Alliance maintains the Wi-Fi Protected Access 2
        (WPA2) certification. WPA2 is based on the robust security
        network (RSN) mechanisms that were originally defined in the
        IEEE 802.11i amendment that is now part of the 802.11-2007
        standard. Two versions of WPA2 exist: WPA2-Personal defines
        security for a SOHO environment, and WPA2- Enterprise defines
        stronger security for enterprise corporate networks. Each
        certified product is required to support both WPA2-Personal
        and WPA2-Enterprise. 

    17. HT clause 20 radios are backward compatible with which of the
        following type of 802.11 radios? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. Clause 18 radios (HR-DSSS)

        B. Clause 17 radios (OFDM)

        C. Clause 14 radios (FHSS)

        D. Clause 19 radios (ERP)

        *答案解析*

        A, B, D. HT clause 20 radios are backward compatible with
        older clause 18 radios (HRDSSS), clause 17 radios (OFDM), and
        clause 19 radios (ERP). In other words, 802.11n radios are
        backward compatible with 802.11b, 802.11a, and 802.11g
        radios. HT radios are not backward compatible with legacy
        frequency hopping radios. 

    18. Which of these 802.11 frames are considered to be 802.11
        control frames? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. ATIM

        B. ACK

        C. CTS

        D. Probe response

        E. PS-Poll

        *答案解析*

        B, C, E. The ACK, CTS and PS-Poll frames are all 802.11
        control frames. The ATIM and probe response frame are 802.11
        management frames. 802.11 control frames assist with the
        delivery of the data frames. Control frames are also used to
        clear the channel, acquire the channel, and provide unicast
        frame acknowledgments. 

    19. What is the maximum size of the payload of a data frame as
        defined by the 802.11-2007 standard?

        A. 1500 bytes

        B. 2304 bytes

        C. 1504 bytes

        D. 1518

        E. 1522

        *答案解析*

        B. One of the differences between 802.3 Ethernet and 802.11
        frames is the frame size. 802.3 frames have a maximum size of
        1,518 bytes with a maximum data payload of 1,500 bytes. If the
        802.3 frames are 802.1Q tagged for VLANs and user priority,
        the maximum size of the 802.3 frame is 1,522 bytes with data
        payload of 1,504 bytes. The payload of an 802.11 data frame is
        the layer 3–7 information found in the MAC Service Data Unit
        (MSDU). The 802.11-2007 standard states that the maximum size
        of the MSDU is 2,304 bytes. The maximum 802.11 frame body size
        is determined by the maximum MSDU size (2,304 octets) plus any
        overhead from encryption. 

    20. How many MAC address fields are found in the MAC header of an
        802.11 frame? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. Four

        B. Three

        C. Two

        D. One

        *答案解析*
        
        A. A huge difference between 802.3 and 802.11 frames is the
        MAC addressing fields. 802.3 frames have only a source address
        (SA) and destination address (DA) in the layer 2
        header. 802.11 frames have four address fields in the MAC
        header. 802.11 frames typically use only three of the MAC
        address fields. However, an 802.11 frame sent within a
        wireless distribution system (WDS) requires four MAC
        addresses. The contents of these four fields can include the
        following MAC addresses: receiver address (RA), transmitter
        address (TA), basic service set identifier (BSSID),
        destination address (DA), and source address (SA). Certain
        frames may not contain some of the address fields. 

* CH02 802.11 Physical (PHY) Layer Frame Format
** Physical L ayer Operations
     不管无线工作站使用的什么物理层实现数据的传输与接收，都有一个共同
     点：每个工作站必须等待并监听是否有数据必须接收和处理，或者必须等
     待当前信道空闲后再传输数据。
*** Carrier Sense/Clear Channel Assessment(CS/CCA)
        如果当前工作站没有进行数据传输或接收数据，则它一定是在监听和侦
        测一个可接收的网络信号的开始部分或是分辩当前信道是否未被占用。

        总之，一个工作站有两种状态：空闲或传输数据。空闲的时候，它可以
        是在等待信道空闲以便进行数据传输，或是监听并等待接收另一个工作站传
        输过来的帧。
*** Tx
        当工作站准备传输一个帧时，它会利用CS/CCA来检测当前信道是否空闲，
        只有当信道可用时，才会进行数据传输。

        当工作站获得传输机会后，它会立即传输，并进入等待接收状态。当接
        收方接收到传输的帧后，会发送一个确认帖（ACK）或者Block ACK确认
        多个帧。
*** Rx
        如果CS/CCA判断当前媒介处于忙碌状态，则工作站需要能够判断当前信道忙
        碌是否由于其他的工作站在传输数据的缘故。传输帧的工作站会在数据
        前面添加一段前导码，这个前导码包含0和1的字符串，接收工作站根据
        前导码来辨识和同步，实际上就是通知接收工作站当前l传输的数据已
        经到达，请准备接收。前导码也包含起始帧分隔符，接收工作站用于判
        断一个帧的开始部分。紧接着前导码是帧头部的长度域，它告诉接收工
        作站帧的多长。当整个帧接收完，如果工作站判断当前接收的帧是完整
        的，则会回一个Ack。
** Physical Layer
     物理层被划分为两个子层。位于上半部分的是叫Physical Layer
     Convergence Procedure(PLCP)，下半部分叫做Physical Medium
     Dependent(PMD)子层。PLCP从MAC层拿到帧，并创建PLCP协议数据单元
     （PPDU）。PMD子层然后将数据进行调制并将数据按比特流进行传输。当
     MPDU传递到物理层时，它被称为PSDU，PSDU然后被做为PPDU的一部分进行
     传输。
*** PLCP Service Data Unit
        PSDU就是物理层进行传输的数据，它与MPDU其实是等价的，只不过是物
        理层的称呼。
*** PLCP Protocol Data Unit
        PLCP在PSDU的基础上添加了一个前导码和物理层头部信息。前导码用于
        双方之间的同步。

        #+CAPTION: Data-Link and Physical layers
        [[./images/2016/2016092601.png]]
*** Physical Medium Dependent
        传输时，当PMD从PCLP子层接收到PPDU后，PMD就会负责传输PPDU。 当
        接收时，PMD监听RF，将调制过的RF信号解释为1或0信号，然后将接收
        到的数据传输到PLCP子层。
** PLCP Protocol Data Unit
*** PLCP Preamble
        当传输数据时，工作站通过发送前导码来通知接收的工作站数据传输已
        经开始。

        IEEE 802.11标准中定义了三种不同的前导码：Long PPDU, short PPDU
        以及OFDM PLCP前导码。802.11n定义了另外三种前导码：non-HT
        legacy PPDU, HT-mixed PPDU, and HT-Greenfi eld PPDU.
**** Long PLCP Preamble

         [[./images/2016/2016092602.png]]

         Tx和Rx之间的同步必须发生在SFD(Start of Frame Delimiter)之间。
         长前导码使用Differential Binary Phase Shift Keying (DBPSK)来传
         输，速率固定为1 Mbps。接收方不一定要接收到整个Sync域，只要接收
         到整个SFD就可以了。
**** Short PLCP Preamble
         #+CAPTION: Short PPDU format
         [[./images/2016/2016092603.png]]
**** OFDM PLCP Preamble
         包含10个short symbols和2个long symbols。In the figure, t1 to
         t10 identify the short training symbols, GI2 is a long guard
         interval,and T1 and T2 identify the long training symbols. Following
         the PLCP preamble is the SIGNAL field and the DATA fields, each with a
         guard interval preceding them. The total training length is 16 μs. A
         short OFDM training symbol consists of 12 subcarriers while a long
         OFDM training symbolconsists of 53 subcarriers.

         [[./images/2016/2016092801.png]]
*** PLCP Header
        Long and Short PLCP Headers are both 48 bits long and contain
        the following four fields:
        1. Signal(8 bits)
           该域的作用是显示传输PSDU使用的调制方法，也即传输MAC帧使用的
           调制方法。

           当使用长的PLCP头时，PSDU可以使用如下4种传输速率：1,2,5.5,11
           Mbps。 当使用短的PLCP头时，只能使用使用3种速率：2, 5.5, 11 Mbps。
        2. Service(8 bits)
           - 5 out of 8 bits are used
           - Bit 3 to indication modulation method (0  CCK:
             Complementary Code Keying, 1- PBCC: Packet Binary
             Convolution Code)  
           - Bit 2 to indicate Transmit Frequency & Symbol clock
             dreived from same clock. 
           - Bit 5-7 to resolve data length field ambiguities for
             ERP-PBCC-11 to ERP-PBCC-33  
           - Bit 7 also used to supplement Length field for CCK 11Mpbs.
        3. Length(16 bits)
            Indicate number of microseconds (μS) that are required to transmit the PSDU.
        4. CRC(16 bits)
           Provide Protection for other 3 fields (signal, service & length)

         #+CAPTION: 802.11n PPDU formats
          [[./images/2016/2016092802.png]]
        802.11n引入了三种新的PPDU：
        1. non-HT legacy PPDU
           - Consist of preamble that uses short & long training symbols (10 STF & 2 LTF).
           - Support for non-HT legacy format is mandatory for 802.11n radios.
           - non-HT transmit only in 20MHz channels.(same format used by 802.11a & 802.11g)
        2. HT-mixed PPDU
           - Preamble contain the non-HT short & long training symbol
             that can be decoded by legacy 802.11a (clause 17) or
             802.11g (clause 19)
           - Rest of the HT-mixed preamble & header cannot be decoded by legacy clients.
           - Tranmission can occur both 20MHz & 40MHz.
           - When 40MHz channel is used all broadcast traffic must be
             sent on legacy 20MHz (for legacy clients) 
        3. HT-greenfield PPDU
           - Preamble not compatible with legacy clients.

         B, D. To make OFDM more resistant to narrowband interference,
         a form of error correction known as convolutional coding is
         performed. The 802.11-2007 standard defines the use of
         convolutional coding as the error correction method to be
         used with OFDM technology. It is a forward error correction
         (FEC) that allows the receiving system to detect and repair
         corrupted bits.

         D. MPDU

         E. PMD

         *答案解析*

         A, D. The PLCP Service Data Unit (PSDU) is the data that the
         PHY transmits. The PSDU is equivalent to the MAC Protocol
         Data Unit (MPDU) that is passed down from the Data-Link
         layer. 

     20. When a Short PLCP Header is used, what speeds can be used for
         transmitting the PSDU? (Choose all that apply.)

         rates are supported: 2 Mbps, 5.5 Mbps, and 11 Mbps.

* CH03 802.11 MAC Sublayer Frame Format
** General 802.11 frame format
     从技术上讲，一个802.11帧就是一个MPDU。一个MPDU主要包含三个基本部
     分：
     - MAC Header
     - Frame Body
     - Frame Check Sequence (FCS)
** MAC header
     MAC头部主要有8个字段，其中4个用于寻址，每个地址字段占用4个字节。
     其他4个字段分别是： Frame Control， Duration/ID， Sequence
     Control， QoS Control，每个字段各占2个字节。如果所有的字段都用到
     时的话，一个802.11 MAC头部的最大大小为32字节。802.11n增加了一个新
     的字段：HT Control，占4个字节。所以，对于11n设备来说，最大的MAC头
     部大小为36字节。不过，通常实际帧的头部大小要小于上述值。
** Frame control field
*** Protocol Version field
       占两个比特，主要标识802.11协议的版本，通常值为0.
*** Type and Sub-type fields
       两个字段一起标识了一个帧的功能。Type占用了2个比特，Sub-type占用
       了4个比特。
*** To DS and From DS fields
        各占一个比特。 用于改变4个地址的意义。
*** More Fragments field
        占用一个比特，不为0时代表后面还有分片需要接收。
*** Retry field
        占用一个比特，不为0时代表当前帧是一个重传帧。Layer 2发生太多的
        重传会导致数据传输的延迟增大，一般重传率应该不大于10%。
*** Power Management field
        占一个比特，表示当前STA是否处于省电状态。
*** More Data field
        当休眠的STA 醒来时，发现AP缓存了发往自己的数据时，通过PS-POLL
        向AP获取数据，当该位不为0时，STA需要不断的发送PS-POLL以获取AP
        中缓存的数据。
*** Protected Frame field
        占用一个比特，当不为0时，代表当前帧的MSDU部分已经加密。
*** Order field
        占用一个比特，当上层要求一个非QoS的数据帧必须严格按序发送数据
        时，该位置为1,其他情况都应该置为0.
** Duration/ID field
     该字段占用16个比特，主要用于3个不同的目的：
     - Virtual carrier-sense
       The main purpose of this field is to reset the NAV timer of
       other stations.
     - Legacy power management
       PS-Poll frames use the field as an association identifier (AID).
     - Contention-free period
       The field is used as an indicator that a point coordination
       function (PCF) process has begun.
** MAC layer addressing
     802.11 MAC层地址主要分为两类：
     - 单播地址
     - 组地址
       + 广播地址
       + 多播地址

      #+CAPTION: 802.11 MAC addressing
       [[./images/2016/2016101001.png]]

** Sequence Control field
     占用16比特， 包含两个子字段： Fragment Number（4比特）， Sequence
     Number（12比特）。 
     
*** Sequence Control Subfields
         值的范围为0~4095. 

*** Understanding the Fragmentation Threshold
        All 802.11 stations can be configured with a fragmentation
        threshold. If the fragmentation threshold is set at 300 bytes,
        any MSDU larger than 300 bytes will be fragmented. 
     
** QoS Control field
     the QoS control field is only used in the MAC header of QoS data
     frames. 

     #+CAPTION: QoS Control field
     [[./images/2016/2016101002.png]]

** Frame Body
     大小可变， 其中控制帧没有帧主体。

     The 802.11-2007 standard states that the maximum size of the MSDU
     is 2,304 bytes.

     An 802.11n station using this method of aggregation can have a
     frame body with a maximum A-MSDU size (3839 or 7935 octets,
     depending upon the STA’s capability), plus any overhead from
     encryption. 

     WEP encryption adds 8 bytes of overhead to the frame body of an
     802.11 data frame.

     TKIP encryption adds 20 bytes of overhead to an 802.11 MPDU.

     CCMP encryption adds 16 bytes of overhead to an 802.11 data frame.

** Review Questions
     1. Based on the 802.11 frame capture shown here, what type of
        networking communications are occurring?

        [[./images/2016/2016101201.png]]

        A. AP to client station

        B. Client station to server

        C. Client station to AP

        D. Server to client station
        
        E. Mesh backhaul

        *答案解析*

        E. The graphic displays four MAC addresses. Although 802.11 frames have four address
       fields in the MAC header, 802.11 frames typically use only three of the MAC address fields.
       An 802.11 frame sent within a wireless distribution system (WDS) requires all four MAC
       addresses. Although the standard does not specifically define procedures for using this format,
       WLAN vendors often implement WDS solutions. Examples of a WDS include WLAN
       bridges, mesh networks, and wireless repeaters.
     
     2. CCMP/AES encryption adds an extra  ____  of overhead to the
        body of an 802.11 data frame.

        A. 16 bytes

        B. 12 bytes

        C. 20 bytes

        D. 10 bytes

        E. None of the above

        *答案解析*

        A. CCMP/AES encryption will add an extra 16 bytes of overhead to the body of an 802.11
        data frame. Eight bytes are added by the CCMP header, and 8 bytes are added by the MIC.
        WEP encryption will add an extra 8 bytes of overhead to the body of an 802.11 data frame.
       When TKIP is implemented, because of the extra overhead from the extended IV and the
       MIC, a total of 20 bytes of overhead is added to the body of an 802.11 data frame.

     3. Which of the following 802.11 frames carry an MSDU payload
        that may eventually be transferred by the integration service
        into an 802.3 Ethernet frame? (Choose all that apply.) 

        A. 802.11 management frames

        B. 802.11 control frames

        C. 802.11 data frames

        D. 802.11 power-management frames

        E. 802.11 action frames

        *答案解析*

        C. Only 802.11 data frames can carry an upper-layer payload (MSDU) within the body
        of the frame. The MSDU can be as large as 2,304 bytes and usually should be encrypted.
        802.11 control frames do not have a body. 802.11 management frames have a body; however,
        the payload is strictly layer 2 information.

     4. What would cause an 802.11 station to retransmit a unicast
        frame? (Choose all that apply.) 

        A. The transmitted unicast frame was corrupted.

        B. The ACK frame from the receiver was corrupted.

        C. The receiver’s buffer was full.

        D. The transmitting station sent a PS-Poll frame.

        E. The transmitting station sent a retransmit notification.

        *答案解析*

        A, B. The receiving station may have received the data, but the returning ACK frame may
        have become corrupted, and the original unicast frame will have to be retransmitted. If the
        unicast frame becomes corrupted for any reason, the receiving station will not send an ACK.

     5. How does a client station indicate that it is using Power Save
        mode?

        A. It transmits a frame to the access point with the Sleep
        field set to 1.

        B. It transmits a frame to the access point with the Power
        Management field set to 1.

        C. Using DTIM, the access point determines when the client
        station uses Power Save mode.

        D. It doesn’t need to, because Power Save mode is the default.

        *答案解析*

        B. When the client station transmits a frame with the Power Management field set to 1, it
        is enabling Power Save mode. The DTIM does not enable Power Save mode; it only notifies
        clients to stay awake in preparation for a multicast or broadcast.

     6. Which field in the MAC header of an 802.11 frame resets the
        NAV timer for all listening 802.11 stations?

        A. NAV

        B. Frame control

        C. Duration/ID

        D. Sequence number

        E. Strictly ordered bit

        *答案解析*

        C. When the listening radio hears a frame transmission from another station, it looks at
        the header of the frame and determines whether the Duration/ID field contains a Duration
        value or an ID value. If the field contains a Duration value, the listening station will set its
        NAV timer to this value.

     7. What are some the reasons for the existence of the Duration/ID
        field of the MAC header of an 802.11 MPDU? (Choose all that
        apply.)

        A. Physical carrier-sense

        B. Fragmentation

        C. Virtual carrier-sense

        D. Integrity check

        E. Power management

        *答案解析*

        C, E. The Duration/ID field has three possible purposes. The main purpose of this field is
        to reset the NAV timer of other stations, which is a virtual carrier-sense mechanism. PS-Poll
        frames use the Duration/ID field as an association identifier (AID) during legacy power
        management processes. Although never implemented by vendors, the Duration/ID field can
        also be used to signal that a contention-free period (CFP) process has begun.

     8. What is the maximum amount of microseconds that can be set on
        the NAV timers of listening stations that hear the
        transmission of another 802.11 station? 

        A. 32,768 μs

        B. 2007 μs

        C. 16,383 μs

        D. 2008 μs

        E. 32,767 μs

        *答案解析*

        E. The main purpose of the Duration/ID field is to reset the NAV timer of other stations.
       When bit 15 of the field is zero, the value in bits 140 represent the duration of a frame
       exchange sequence remaining after the frame in which the Duration value is found. Bits
       140 can have a Duration value of 0 to 32,767. The Duration value translates into microseconds
       when resetting NAV timers of other stations. The other common use of the Duration/
       ID field is as an AID in PS-Poll control frames. When bits 15 and 14 have a value of 1,
       bits 130 can be used to represent an AID in PS-Poll frames from 1 to 2007.

     9. What are some of the negative effects of layer 2
        retransmissions? (Choose all that apply.) 

        A. Decreased range

        B. Excessive MAC sublayer overhead

        C. Decreased latency

        D. Increased latency

        E. Jitter

        *答案解析*

        B, D, E. Excessive layer 2 retransmissions adversely affect the WLAN in two ways. First,
        layer 2 retransmissions increase MAC overhead and therefore decrease throughput. Second,
        if application data has to be retransmitted at layer 2, the timely delivery of application traffic
       becomes delayed or inconsistent. Applications such as VoIP depend on the timely and consistent
       delivery of the IP packet. Excessive layer 2 retransmissions usually result in increased
       latency and jitter problems for time-sensitive applications such as voice and video.

     10. When an AP sends a unicast frame to VoWiFi client station,
         which of the other stations will not update their NAV timers
         based on the Duration value represented in the Duration/ID
         field in the unicast frame sent by the AP? (Choose all that
         apply.) 

         A. Transmitting access point

         B. Another access point nearby on the same channel

         C. All the other client stations

         D. The VoWiFi client

         E. Any other clients within listening range on the same
         channel

         *答案解析*

         A, D. The NAV is not updated when the receiver address (RA) is the same as the receiving
        station’s MAC address. Therefore, in this scenario, the Duration value did not reset the
        VoWiFi client’s NAV because it was the receiver. You should also understand that the Duration
        value of the transmitting station does not reset the transmitting stations NAV timer.
        The transmitter cannot hear its own transmitted frame. The transmitter’s NAV will be zero
        after transmitting, just like it was zero before the transmitter gained control of the medium.
        The AP was the transmitter so the Duration value did not reset its NAV. Any other client or
        AP stations within hearing range on the same channel will reset their NAV, even if they are
        not members of the BSS.

     11. Which of these statements regarding the four MAC address
         fields in the header of a data MPDU are accurate? (Choose all
         that apply.) 

         A. Address 2 is always the transmitter address (TA).

         B. Address 3 is always the transmitter address (TA).

         C. Address 1 is always the basic service set identifier
         (BSSID).

         D. Address 1 is always the receiver address (RA).

         *答案解析*

         A, D. Depending on how the To DS and From DS fields are used, the definition of the four
        MAC fields will change. One constant, however, is that the Address 1 field will always be
        the receiver address (RA) but may have a second definition as well. The Address 2 field will
        always be the transmitter address (TA) but also may have a second definition. Address 3 is
        normally used to additional MAC address information. Address 4 is used only in the case
        of a WDS.

     12. Which of the following is a possible scenario when the To DS
         field and the From DS field both have a value of 0? (Choose
         all that apply.)

         A. The frame transmission is a control frame.

         B. An ad hoc network exists.

         C. The frame transmission is a simple data frame.

         D. Fragmentation is not being used.

         E. The frame transmission is a management frame.

         *答案解析*

         A, B, E. When both bits are set to 0, several different scenarios exist. The most common
         scenario is that the frames are either management or control frames. Management and
         control frames do not have an MSDU payload, and therefore their final destination is never
         the distribution system (DS). Management and control exist only at the MAC sublayer
         and therefore have no need to be translated by the integration service (IS) and never are
         delivered to the distribution system service (DSS). Another scenario is a direct data frame
         transfer from one STA to another STA within an independent basic service set (IBSS), more
         commonly known as an ad hoc network. The third scenario involves what is known as a
         station-to-station link (STSL), which involves a data frame being sent directly from one client
         station to another client station that belongs to the same BSS, thereby bypassing the AP.

     13. What can you conclude about this frame based on the frame
         capture graphic shown here?(Choose all that apply.) 

         [[./images/2016/2016101202.png]]

         A. This is the second fragment of an MSDU.

         B. This is the third fragment of an MSDU.

         C. The AP is using fragmentation.

         D. This is the last transmitted fragment of an MSDU.

         E. The client station is using fragmentation.

         *答案解析*

         B, C, D. In the Sequence Control field, the Fragment Number subfield contains a 4-bit
         number assigned to each fragment of an MSDU. The first, or only, fragment of an MSDU is
         assigned a fragment number of 0. Each successive fragment is assigned a sequentially incremented
         fragment number. The graphic shows a fragment number of 2, which means it is the
         third fragment. The More Fragments field indicates a value of 0, which means it is the last
         transmitted fragment. The To DS field has a value of 0, and the From DS field has a value of
         1, which means this is a downstream transmission from an AP to a client station.

     14. What can you conclude about this frame based on the frame
         capture graphic shown here?Choose all that apply.) 

         [[./images/2016/2016101203.png]]

         A. The Duration/ID field is an AID.

         B. This is first fragment of a fragmented MSDU.

         C. The AP is buffering the client station’s traffic.

         D. Fragmentation is not being used.

         E. This is a PS-Poll frame.

         *答案解析*

         C, D. The Power Management field indicates a value of 1, meaning that the client STA is in
         Power Save mode and that the AP must buffer the client STA’s traffic. Fragmentation is not
         being used because the frag number in the Sequence Control field has a value of 0 and the
         More Fragments field also has a value of 0. The Subtype field indicates that this is a Null
         data frame and not a PS-Poll frame. PS-Poll frames are the only frames that use the Duration/
         ID field as an association identifier (AID).
         
     15. What can you conclude about this frame based on the frame
         capture graphic shown here?

         [[./images/2016/2016101204.png]]

         A. This data frame has no frame body.

         B. CCMP encryption is being used.

         C. This is an IBSS topology.

         D. No data privacy is being provided.

         E. The ACK frame was delivered successfully.

         *答案解析*

         D. The Protected Frame field has a value of 0, which indicates that the MSDU payload of
         this simple data frame is not encrypted.

     16. What can you conclude about this frame based on the frame
         capture graphic shown here?(Choose all that apply.) 

         [[./images/2016/2016101205.png]]

         A. This is a unicast frame.

         B. The frame check sequence (FCS) of the previous attempt of
         the same frame failed at the receiving station.

         C. This is a multicast frame.

         D. This is a mesh backhaul transmission.

         E. The ACK frame was delivered successfully.

         *答案解析*

         A, B. The Retry field indicates a value of 1, meaning this is a retransmission. Every time
         an 802.11 radio transmits a unicast frame, if the frame is received properly and the cyclic
         redundancy check (CRC) of the FCS passes, the 802.11 radio that received the frame will
         reply with an acknowledgment (ACK) frame. If the ACK is received, the original station
         knows that the frame transfer was successful. All unicast 802.11 frames must be acknowledged.
         Broadcast and multicast frames do not require an acknowledgment.
        
         If any portion of a unicast frame is corrupted, the CRC will fail, and the receiving
         802.11 radio will not send an ACK frame to the transmitting 802.11 radio. If an ACK
         frame is not received by the original transmitting radio, the unicast frame is not acknowledged
         and will have to be retransmitted.
        
     17. When the To DS field has a value of 0 and the From DS field
         has a value of 1, which of these statements possibly are
         accurate? (Choose all that apply.) 

         A. The frame transmission is a control frame.

         B. This is a DHCP response packet.

         C. The frame transmission is a data frame.

         D. Client STA is transmitting.

         E. The frame transmission is a management frame.

         *答案解析*

         B, C. When the To DS bit is set to 0 and the From DS bit is set to 1, this indicates that an
         802.11 data frame is being sent downstream from an access point to a client station. The
         original source of the MSDU payload of the 802.11 data frame is an address that exists on
         the distribution system medium (DSM). An example is a DHCP server that resides on the
         802.3 network forwarding a DHCP response packet through an AP with the final destination
         being an 802.11 client station.
        
     18. How many bytes is the frame body of an 802.11 MPDU?

         A. 0-2304

         B. 2304

         C. 2346

         D. 4095

         E. Variable

         *答案解析*

         E. The frame body is of variable size. The maximum frame body size is determined by
         the maximum MSDU size (2,304 octets) plus any overhead from encryption. The 802.11n-
         2009 HT amendment defines a frame aggregation method called Aggregate MAC Service
         Data Unit (A-MSDU). An 802.11n station using this method of aggregation can have a
         frame body with a maximum A-MSDU size (3839 or 7935 octets, depending upon the
         STA’s capability), plus any overhead from encryption.

     19. How many MAC addresses are found in an 802.3 frame?

         A. Four

         B. Three

         C. Two

         D. One

         E. Zero

         *答案解析*

         C. 802.3 Ethernet frames have only a source address (SA) and destination address (DA)
         in the layer 2 header. 802.11 frames have four address fields in the MAC header. The contents
         of these four fields can include the following MAC addresses: receiver address (RA),
         transmitter address (TA), basic service set identifier (BSSID), destination address (DA), and
         source address (SA). In other words, an 802.11 frame can contain as many as four MAC
         addresses with five different meanings.
         
     20. How does a transmitting station maintain control of the
         medium during a fragment burst?(Choose all that apply.) 

         A. Random backoff algorithm

         B. Duration

         C. DIFS

         D. Sequence Control

         E. SIFS

         *答案解析*

         B, E. Fragments are always sent in what is known as a fragment burst. Once the transmitting
         station gains control of the medium, it maintains control through two mechanisms:
         Duration values (which set other stations’ NAVs) and SIFS. First, the value of the Duration
         field in the MAC header of data fragments and ACK frames is used to reserve the medium
         for the next fragment. As a backup mechanism, SIFS is used between data fragments
         and ACK frames in order to preempt those stations that are trying to gain control of the
         medium using DIFS.

    管理帧总是是MAC层处理，它们不会被传递给上层（for app），另外，它们
    的To DS和From DS的值总是为0.
*** Beacons
    MaxChannelTime: defined in each driver MIB, duration of dwelling
    time on each channel.

    Beacon frames are sent periodically, at a time called target beacon transmission time
    (TBTT) and at a rate defined by the dot11BeaconPeriod parameter in
    the AP MIB.

    dot11BeaconPeriod 这个参数默认是100 TU(time units)。 

    AP以某个固定的时间间隔发送Beacon帧，并通知下一个Beacon帧发送的时间。
    如果当前媒介忙碌，会推迟当前Beacon帧的发送，但是不会影响下一个
    Beacon帧的发送，下一个Beacon帧仍然会按照预定的时间进行发送。

*** Probe Request / Response
    
**** Probe Request Frame
     主要用于主动扫描，查找AP信息。
     #+CAPTION: Elements and fields in a probe request frame body
     | Order | Information                   | Note                                                                                                                          |

     |     5 | Vendor Specific               | One or more vendor-specific information elements may appear in this frame. This information element follows all other information elements.                                                                                                                            |
     |-------+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

     STA也可以利用Probe Request来发现某个网络特定的信息。 为了支持这个
     目的，Probe Request可以包含一个 Request Information信息， 它们可以
     请求一个或多个额外的参数。 
     #+CAPTION: Request Information element
     | Element ID              | Length                 |
     |-------------------------+------------------------|
     | Requested element ID 1  | Requested element ID 2 |
     | ...                     | ...                    |
     | Requested element ID N1 | Requested element ID N                       |
     |-------------------------+----------------------------------------------|
     这些IE信息都是可选的。 另外， Probe Request也可以携带一些厂商自定
     义的IE信息。

**** Probe Response Frame
      主要回应对方的 Probe Request请求。 携带的信息与Beacon帧类似。与
      beacon帧相比，主要有如下一些区别：
      1. The beacon frame contains a TIM field; the probe response does not.
      2. The beacon frame can contain a QoS Capability Information
         element that announces basic QoS support to the cell.
      3. The probe response also contains the Requested Information
         elements that may have  been requested by the probing station.

*** Authentication
    In all cases, after having performed a network discovery through the probe request/
    probe response exchange or by listening to beacons, a station wanting to join a cell goes
    through an authentication process, exchanging authentication frames with the access point.
    Unlike the probe and association phases, which use a different frame for the request and
    the response, there is only one type of authentication frame.

    #+CAPTION: Authentication frame format
    [[./images/2016/2016101801.png]]
    
**** Open System
     The initial purpose of the authentication frame is to validate the
     device type, in other words, verify that the requesting station
     has proper 802.11 capabilities to join the cell. 

     This exchange is based on a simple two-frame dialogue
     (authentication request, authentication response)

     
**** WEP Shared Key
     This shared key exchange adds two frames to the default Open
     System authentication, resulting in a four-frame exchange. 

     The Authentication Algorithm number field value describes which
     authentication system is used (0 for Open System and 1 for Shared
     Key).

     the 2-byte Authentication Transaction Sequence Number field
     indicates the current state of progress through the multistep
     transaction.

*** Association Request / Response
    
**** Association Request Frame
     认证成功后，STA就会进入关联阶段， 这个交互的目的是为了加入这个BSS
     并获取一个AID。

     通过Association Request携带的信息，使AP了解STA的相关能力信息，这样
     AP就可以决定如何与该STA进行通信。

**** Association Response Frame
    当AP收到Association Request后，它会检查每一个802.11参数，并与自己
    支持的802.11参数进行匹配，如果出现不匹配的情况，AP会看当前的差异
    是否属于Bloocking Factor。 如果是的话，AP就会拒绝关联，否则的话，
    AP就会标记这个差异，并在回Association Response的时候携带自己的
    802.11参数。

    AP返回一个状态码，0代表关联成功。 并为STA分配一个AID，它是1~2007(2
    字节长，只用到最低的14个Bit,其他位为1.)

*** Disassociation
    通信的任何一方都可以主动发出这个帧。 它的格式如下：
    #+CAPTION: Disassociation frame format
    [[./images/2016/2016101804.png]]

    该帧可能是单播帧，也可能是多播帧。 其IE信息如下：

    |-------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

    处于Disassociated状态的STA仍然是处于Authenticated状态，它们可以直接
    进行重新关联。

*** Deauthentication
    当双方通信完成，会发送此帧结束会话。 该帧的格式与Disassociation类似。
*** Reassociation Request / Response
**** Reassociation Request Frame
     该帧只能由STA 发出。 使用场景主要是： 当STA已经关联到一个ESS并想关
     联到同一个ESS下的另一个AP上。 也可用于： 当STA短暂离开当前关联的AP
     后，重新关联此AP。 也可用于：当Authenticator timer过期后，STA
     进行认证和重新关联。已经关联上某个AP的STA也可以通过此帧重新协商一
     些参数。

     #+CAPTION: Reassociation request frame format
     [[./images/2016/2016101805.png]]

**** Reassociation Response Frame
     An AP uses the reassociation response frame in response to a
     reassociation request frame.其格式与Association Response类似。

*** ATIM Frame
    The ATIM frame is specific to IBSS networks and used for
    distribution of buffered frames to stations in sleep mode in the
    ad hoc network. 

*** Action Frame
       Action frames form the 12th and last type of management frame. They
       are used to trigger specific actions in the cell.
   
   #+CAPTION: Action frame format
   [[./images/2016/2016101806.png]]
   
** Information Elements and Fields
   
*** Management Frame Fields
   
**** Timestamp Field
          8字节长， 通常出现在Beacon帧和Probe Response帧。 
          the timestamp is a value representing the time on the access
          point, which is the number of microseconds the AP has been
          active. 

          The stations in the cell use that timestamp value to adjust
          their own clock(using their Time Synchronization Function).
**** Beacon Interval Field
           2字节长， The Beacon Interval field represents the number
           of time units between target beacon transmission times
           (TBTTs). 

           The default value is 100 TUs (0.102400 seconds), but the
           field size allows for any value between 1 and more than 67
           seconds! 

           这个值不能太长，也不太短。太短的话， STA无法快速地从休眠的
           状态下醒来监听Beacon帧。 会导致断线。
**** Capability Information Field
          The Capability Information field contains a number of
          subfields that are used to indicate requested or advertised
          optional capabilities. 

          2个字节长， Capability Information field exists in several
          management frames (beacons,probe response, association
          request, association response, reassociation request,
          andreassociation response). 
          
          #+CAPTION: Capability Information field
          [[./images/2016/2016101901.png]]
          
***** ESS/IBSS Subfields
            The ESS bit indicates whether the beacon is coming from an
            AP (1) or not (0).  The IBSS bit indicates whether the
            beacon is coming from an IBSS station (1) or not (0). 

***** Privacy Subfield
             APs set the Privacy subfield to 1 if data confidentiality is required for all data frames
             exchanged within the BSS. If data confidentiality is not required, the Privacy subfield is set
             to 0.

             The Privacy field only shows the requirement (or not)
             for encryption when sending data frames.

***** Short Preamble Subfield
            当为1时， 表示可使用short preamble和long preamble。 为0时，
            只允许使用long preamble。 
***** Channel Agility Subfield
            Its aim was to offer the possibility for the center channel to shift periodically
            slightly up and down, in the hopes of avoiding
            interferences.

            The Channel Agility feature
            was never widely implemented. It is still present as a possibility in the Capability field, but
            only for HR/DSSS stations (OFDM does not implement this
            feature).
            
***** Spectrum Management Subfield
            related to 802.11h, set this field to reflect that they
            implement DFS and TPC.

***** QoS Subfield
            this field shows whether the AP supports QoS. The
            QoS subfield in the Capability Information field simply tells the cell “I can do QoS; look for
            other QoS fields in my frames.”

***** Short Slot Time Subfield
            Standard slot time used to be 20 μs with 802.11 and 802.11b and
            was reduced to 9 μs with 802.11g (802.11a also uses 9 μs
            slot times).

            This subfield determines
            whether short slot time is allowed in the cell (the Short
            Slot Time subfield set to 1)

            When AP set this filed, it's a clear sign that the AP is
            not Supporting 802.11b. 
            
***** APSD Subfield
            When this APSD bit is set to 1, the AP supports the
            802.11e APSD feature.

            STA发出的association or reassociation requests该域总是设为
            0, 因为它功能是针对整个BSS的，不是单个STA能作出的决定。

***** DSSS-OFDM Subfield
            When this bit is set to 1, the DSSS-OFDM mode is allowed
            in the cell。 

            This bit is always set to 0 for 802.11a networks.

**** Listen Interval Field
          the Listen Interval field is used to indicate to the AP how often a station in Power Save
          mode wakes to listen to beacon management frames.

          This value is an integer expressed in
          beacon interval units (for example, a value of 3 indicates that the station wakes up every
          three beacons). This field is 2 bytes long, which means that the maximum interval could
          be 65,535.

**** Status Code Field
          The Status Code fi eld is used in a response management frame to indicate the success or
          failure of a requested operation.

**** Association ID Field
          2个字节， AP为关联上的STA 分配的AID， 值的范围为1~2007. 

**** Reason Code Field
          This Reason Code field is used to indicate the reason that an unsolicited notification management
          frame of type disassociation, deauthentication, DELTS, DELBA, or DLS teardown
          was generated.

          The Status Code field
          indicates if a request is successful and details the cause
          of the failure.

          The Reason Code
          fi eld is present only when the frames listed earlier are sent to a station without the station
          asking for any negotiation of any parameter.

*** Management Frame Information Elements
        #+CAPTION: Generic information element format
        [[./images/2016/2016101902.png]]

**** Extended Capabilities Element
          对Capability Information field的一个扩展，包含其没有的一些IE
          信息。 它出现在以下的类型中： beacons, probe responses,
          association requests, association responses, reassociation
          requests, and reassociation responses. 
          
**** SSID Element
          出现在如下一些类型的帧中：beacons, probe requests, probe
          responses, association requests, and reassociation requests.
          
          ID为0, SSID字符串的最大长度为32. 
          
          如果AP支持多个SSID， 就会在每个beacon interval 发送相应数量
          的beacon帧。 

          If your AP is expected to send a beacon
          every 100 TUs and your AP supports 5 SSIDs, the AP will send one beacon every 20 TU,
          advertising its capabilities for each SSID in turn.

**** Supported Rates Element
           The Supported Rates element is present in beacons, probe requests, probe responses, and all
           association frames。

           This element
           specifies up to eight rates.

           In the Supported Rates field, the length field is encoded as 1 to 8 octets, where
           each octet describes a single supported rate.

           Each rate is listed over one octet, with the following
           logic:
           - The last bit (bit 7) is set to 1 if the rate is a basic
             rate (NN or mandatory rate) and set to 0 if the rate is
             simply supported.
           - The other seven bits (bits 0 to 6) are set to the data
             rate, if necessary rounded up to the next 500 Kbps, in
             units of 500 Kbps. 

             For example, a 5.5 Mbps rate contained in the BSSBasicRateSet parameter is encoded
           as 10001011 (10000000 because it is set to Basic Rate, and binary 1011 for decimal
           11, because 5.5 Mbps are 11 times 500 kbps); 2 Mbps
           supported would be 00000100.

           任何一个想加入某个AP的STA必须支持AP指定的基本速率。 

**** Extended Supported Rates Element
          The Extended Supported Rates element specifies the supported rates not carried in the
          Supported Rates element.

          The
          information element is encoded as 1 to 255 octets where each octet describes a single supported
          rate.

**** Extended Rate PHY (ERP) Element
          The ERP element is present only on 2.4 GHz networks supporting 802.11g and is present
          in beacons and probe responses.

**** Robust Security Network (RSN) Information Element
         当使用WPA/WPA2来决定AP的认证和加密机制时，这个IE非常重要。

         RSN的ID是48, 主要存在于beacons, probe responses,association
         responses, and reassociation responses.其结构如下：

         #+CAPTION: RSN element
         [[./images/2016/2016102001.png]]
         
         - Version
         总是设为1.
         - Pairwise Cipher Suite Count
         代表支持多少种加密算法。
         - Pairwise Cipher Suite List field
           Each field is of course 4 bytes long, because each cipher
           is represented over 4 bytes.

           When a station supports several ciphers, it always chooses
           the strongest one first (in order: CCMP, TKIP, WEP 104, WEP
           40). 
           
           *Authentication and Key Management (AKM)*

           Now that the ciphers allowed in the cell are defined, you still need to inform potential
           cell clients about how they are supposed to authenticate in
           order to join the cell.

           - AKM Suite count
             the number of methods allowed

           - AKM Suite list
             displays each individual method. each method is coded
             over 4 bytes: the first 3 bytes are an OUI, and the last
             byte is one of the methods supported by the vendor
             matching the OUI. 
             
             The 802.11i committee defined two methods : 00-0F-AC-1 for 802.1X or PMK caching
             and 00-0F-AC-2 for PSK
         
**** Basic Service Set (BSS) Load Element
           This element is used only when QoS is supported. It is
           often called QBSS Load element. 
           
           从AP的角度提供了网络单元的信息， 通常由AP发出， 接收的STA根
           据里面提供的信息决定如何进行漫游。 
           
           #+CAPTION: BSS Load element
           [[./images/2016/2016101002.png]]
           
           - station count
             a simple number, showing how many stations are currently
             associated to the cell.
           - Channel Utilization
             the percentage of time, normalized to 255, that the AP
             sensed the medium was busy, as indicated by either the
             physical or virtual carrier sense mechanism.

             The AP senses the medium, just like any other station, every slot time. At regular intervals
           (every 50 beacons by default, which represents 5.12 seconds if the beacons are sent
           at 100 TU intervals), the AP looks over the last period and counts how many times the
           network was seen as busy and how many times the network was seen as idle. The AP then
           calculates a simple percentage and translates it into a 0
           to 255 range.

           This information is used by QoS stations to gauge the space
           available on several APs in range. 
           
**** Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) Parameter Element
           In most QoS-enabled networks, this field is not used, and
           the same information is provided through the WMM or the WME
           vendor-specific element. 
           
**** QoS Capability Element
           This element is used only when QoS is supported. It is used
           as a replacement to the EDCA Parameter element when EDCA
           Parameter is not present. It is also used by the AP to communicate
           to the cell the QoS information.

           In most QoS-enabled networks, this field is not used, and
           the same information is provided through the WMM or the WME
           vendor-specific element. 

**** Direct Sequence Parameter Set Element
           This element is used by both the DSSS and OFDM systems, on
           both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz spectrums. It is a very important
           field that  /simply indicates the current channel./ 
           
           #+CAPTION: DS Parameter Set element
           [[[./images/2016/2016102003.png]]]

           代表发送方发送数据时所在的Central Channel或Primary Channel
           的值。

**** Traffic Indication Map (TIM) Element
           This element is present only in beacons.  

           #+CAPTION: TIM element
           [[./images/2016/2016102004.png]]

           The DTIM is not present in all beacons and all TIMs. At regular intervals (usually configurable
           on the AP), the beacon will contain a TIM that will also be a DTIM. The DTIM
           purpose is easy to understand. The AP uses the beacon frames Delivery Traffic Indication
           Message (DTIM) information to inform the cell if it has broadcasts or multicasts frames
           buffered.

           Stations in low power mode should wake up at least for every beacon that is a
           DTIM. The DTIM does not have to be in every beacon but can, for example, occur every
           two to five beacons. The DTIM is contained in the TIM, so in that case it is said that the
           TIM is also a DTIM.

           - DTIM period

             the number of beacon intervals between successive DTIMs
             (for example, 3 means every third beacon is a
             DTIM). Maximum Value is 255, Minimum Value is 1. 

           - DTIM Count

             how many beacon frames (including the current frame)
             appear before the next DTIM.

             A DTIM Count field of 0 indicates that the current TIM is
             a DTIM. A DTIM count of 1 indicates that the next beacon
             is a DTIM.

             MAX DTIM Count = DTIM period - 1

           - Bitmap Control field

             The first bit of the bitmap control field is used to
             announce the presence of multicast or broadcast traffic
             buffered on the AP. 

             The next 7 bits of the Bitmap Control field, along with
             the virtual bitmap, represent the stations in low power
             mode for which the AP has traffic buffered. 

             The remaining seven bits are the Bitmap Offset, which may
             have any value between 0 and 127. 通过设置它的值，可以节
             省空间。 Partial Virtual Bitmap从开始起的一些字节全为0，
             则Bitmap Offset可以显示哪些字节可以被跳过。Bitmap Offset
             的值乘以2，结果就是Partial Virtual Bitmap中从第一字节开始
             算全为0的字节数。例如，如果AID在1和39之间的STA都没有缓存
             的单播帧，则Bitmap Offset的值为2， 则Partial Virtual
             Bitmap只需要使用一个全零的字节表示，开始的4个字节会认为是
             全零。

           - Partial Virtual Bitmap
             
             The Partial Virtual Bitmap value is just a series of
             flags (bits set to either a 1 or a 0) indicating whether
             each associated station has unicast frames buffered at
             the AP.

             每个分配了AID的STA会对应PartialVirtual Bitmap中的某个比特
             位，如果比特位为1，则代表AP有缓存该STA的帧。
             
**** IBSS Parameter Set Element
           This element is present only on probe responses and beacons
           of stations in an IBSS.

**** Country Element
          802.11d. The Country field defines the country of operation,
          along with the allowed channels and maximum transmit power. 

          It is not a mandatory field and is typically found on APs
          that can support several country settings. 
          
**** Power Constraint Element
           802.11h. In the Power Constraint fi eld, the AP indicates
           how much lower than this maximum power participants should
           try to go. 
           
**** TPC Report Element
           802.1h. The TPC Report element contains transmit power and
           link margin information, usually sent in response to a TPC
           Request element. 
           
**** Channel Switch Announcement Element
           802.1h. When a radar blast is detected, all stations must
           leave the affected channel. The AP can be set to announce
           to the cell which is the next channel.
           
**** Quiet Element
          802.1h. An AP can request a quiet time during which no
          stations should transmit in order to test the channel for
          the presence of radars. 
          
**** Vendor-Specific Elements
          Beyond all the options defi ned by the standard or any of its amendments, each vendor can
          defi ne proprietary options and add them to any management
          frames’ supporting elements

          #+CAPTION: Vendor-specific element
          [[./images/2016/2016102005.png]]

          Each vendor wanting to implement vendor-specific elements needs to obtain an OUI for
          this purpose from the IEEE. The vendor will display this OUI in the element header, along
          with the element ID 221, which identifies a vendor-specific
          element.
          
** Action Frames
     Action frames are a type of management frame used to trigger an
     action in the cell.
     
     #+CAPTION: Action frame structure
     [[./images/2016/20102006.png]]

     The frame body contains three sections:
     - Category
       Describes the action frame type. Category allows you to know
       which family the action frame belongs to and which protocol
       introduced it.
     - Action
       The action to perform. It is usually a number. You need to know
       the category to understand which action is called.
     - Element
       Adds additional information specific to the action.

*** Admission Control (802.11e)
        QoS 按不同优先级传输数据。  traffic stream（TS）
        
**** ADDTS Request and ADDTS Response Frames
          The ADDTS request is always sent by a station (that is, never by an access point) wanting
          to add a new TS to the cell.
          
**** DELTS Frames
          Once a TS is admitted, a station receives the predetermined QoS level negotiated in the
          ADDTS exchange. After a while, the TS can be removed to free
          resources from the cell.
          
**** Schedule Frames
          When a TS is admitted, the schedule frame is transmitted by the AP to the station to
          announce the schedule of delivery of data and polls (when
          the station also uses power save).

** Review Questions
     1. How many management frame types are described by the
        802.11-2007 standard?

        A. 4

        B. 11

        C. 12

        D. 13

        *答案解析*

        C. The 802.11-2007 standard describes 12 management frame types: beacon, probe request,
        probe response, authentication, association request, association response, reassociation
        request, reassociation response, disassociation, deauthentication, ATIM, and action frame.

     2. In which frame would you find a timestamp field?

        A. Beacon

        B. Association request

        C. Association response

        D. Authentication

        *答案解析*

        A. The timestamp is present in beacons and is used by stations associated to the cell as a clock
        reference. The time synchronization function uses the timestamp to align the stations’ cell
        clock to the AP clock.

     3. What is the purpose of the Listen Interval field?

        A. To determine the next QoS service period

        B. To organize the detection of radar blasts

        C. To optimize BSS Fast Roaming transition times

        D. To specify when stations in low power mode would wake up

        *答案解析*

        D. In frames sent from stations to access points (association request, reassociation request),
        the Listen Interval field is used to indicate to the AP how often a station in Power Save
        mode wakes to listen to beacon management frames.
        
     4. In which case would a station send a reassociation frame?

        A. To rejoin an IBSS after a member disconnected

        B. To join a new AP on the same ESS

        C. To rejoin an AP after deauthentication occurred

        D. To reenter the cell after the AP jumped to a new channel

        *答案解析*
        
        B. This type of frame can be sent only by a station to an access point and is used when the
        station is already associated to the ESS and wants to associate to another access point connecting
        to the same ESS.

     5. How does a QoS station request a quality of service commitment
        from its AP?

        A. By using the ADDTS frame

        B. By using the TSPEC request frame

        C. By using the QoS BSS Load action frame

        D. By sending the Schedule Request frame

        *答案解析*

        A. QoS station use the ADDTS frame to ask the AP to add a traffic stream to the cell. The
        ADDTS contains a TSPEC element describing the traffic specifications. There is no such
        thing as a TSPEC request frame. The QBSS Load Element is present in the beacon to inform
        potential client stations about the current load in the cell. Schedule is a frame sent by the AP
        to determine when the service period will start.
        
     6. How long do stations have before leaving a channel affected by
        a radar blast?

        A. 260 milliseconds

        B. 10 seconds

        C. 30 seconds

        D. 60 seconds

        *答案解析*

        B. Stations detecting a radar blast have 10 seconds from the moment of detection to leave
        the affected frequency. During this interval, they have the right to still send up to 260 milliseconds
        worth of frames. Upon getting to a new channel, they can respect a quiet interval
        to listen for radar blasts on the new frequency. This quiet interval is commonly 60 seconds.
        Stations cannot return to the affected channel for 30 minutes.
       
     7. Which of the following is true about the Privacy subfield?

        A. When its value is 1, WEP encryption is in place.

        B. When its value is 1, any encryption may be in place.

        C. Its values can be 0 for no encryption, 1 for WEP, 2 for
        WPA, and 3 for WPA2.

        D. When its value is 1, the station is in low power mode and
        not listening to the cell frames.

        *答案解析*

        B. Although originally designed for WEP, the Privacy subfield
        today indicates that some form of encryption is in place, WEP,
        TKIP, or AES. 

     8. What is the beacon default interval?

        A. 100 milliseconds

        B. 102.4 TUs

        C. 102.4 milliseconds

        D. 100 TBTTs

        *答案解析*

        C. A beacon is sent by default every 102.4 milliseconds or 100 TUs (one time unit is
        1.024 millisecond). The time at which the next beacon should be sent is the target beacon
        transmission time (TBTT). The AP tries to send the beacon at each
        planned TBTT.
        
     9. Which of the following is the OUI used by the IEEE in the RSN
        information element?

        A. 00-00-00

        B. 0E-EE-00

        C. 11-11-11

        D. 00-0F-AC

        *答案解析*

        D. The RSN element uses a cipher suite to describe what encryption should be used for
        unicast or broadcast/multicast frames. The element is composed of an organization unique
        identifier representing the cipher vendor and of a cipher number for this vendor. The IEEE
        uses the OUI 00-0F-AC.
       
     10. Which amendment uses FT frames?

         A. 802.11i

         B. 802.11n

         C. 802.11r

         D. 802.11w

         *答案解析*

         C. FT frames are action frames defined by the BSS Fast Transition amendment 802.11r and
         are used for fast and secure roaming between APs part of the same ESS.

     11. What should a station where an ADDTS request has been refused
         do next?

         A. Retry the same or a lower TSPEC

         B. Revert back to PCF

         C. Roam to the next AP

         D. Drop the current TS and negotiate the next TS

         *答案解析*

         A. When an ADDTS is denied by an AP, the station cannot get the QoS level it requested,
         usually because there was not enough space to accept this TS as requested in the cell. The
         station can retry, hoping that other TSPEC of the same level got terminated and that space
         becomes available, or it can revert its ADDTS to a lower QoS level and retry. A station
         would not leave the cell by default, because roaming takes longer than retry, and would not
         drop its queued traffic. PCF was never implemented by any vendor.
        
     12. What information is sent in a TPC report sent from station A
         to station B?

         A. Link margin as measured by A

         B. Link margin as measured by B

         C. A to B attenuation value
         
         D. B to A attenuation value

         *答案解析*
         
         A. Station A sends its link margin, that is to say what margin it wants B to take when
         reducing its power. If station A link margin is 5 dB and B calculates that it can send with its
         power down to 6 dBm, B will send at 11 dBm to respect station A’s link margin request.
        
     13. What is the category number allocated to QoS-related action
         frames?

         A. 0

         B. 1

         C. 4

         D. 5

         *答案解析*

         B. The 802.11e amendment defines several action frames. QoS-related frames are Category 1.
         Category 0 is allocated to spectrum management frames introduced by the 802.11h amendment.
         Category 4 is used by public action frames introduced by the 802.11w amendment.
         Category 5 is used by radio measurement action frames introduced by the 802.11k
         amendment.

     14. What does ATIM stand for?

         A. Ad Hoc Traffic Indication Message

         B. Announcement Traffic Indication Message

         C. Announcement Traffic Indication Map

         D. Ad Hoc Traffic Indication Map

         *答案解析*

         B. ATIM stands for Announcement Traffic Indication Message. Don’t confuse this acronym
         with Traffic Indication Map (TIM) or Delivery Traffic Indication Message (DTIM).

     15. Which information element is a summary of the AP QoS
         capabilities?

         A. EDCA Parameter Set

         B. TSPEC

         C. QoS Subfield

         D. QoS Capabilities

         *答案解析*

         D. The QoS Capabilities IE summarizes the AP QoS Capabilities. A more extensive support
         description is given in the EDCA parameter set. TSPEC element is used by stations
         (not APs) requesting QoS level through ADDTS Request frames. It can be found in the AP
         answers but only to describe the original station request, not the AP capabilities. The QoS
         subfield simply informs whether the AP supports QoS, without details about its capabilities.
    
     16. How does an AP hide its SSID (SSID not broadcasted in
         beacons)?

         A. By not sending the SSID information element

         B. By sending an empty SSID information element

         C. By stopping beacon broadcasts

         D. By moving the SSID information element to the
         vendor-specific section of the beacon

         *答案解析*

         B. An AP cannot stop broadcasting beacons (most clients would disconnect). The SSID
         information element has to be present, but its size is not fixed. APs hide the SSID by sending
         an empty SSID IE. Moving the SSID IE to the vendor-specific section would mean removing
         the SSID IE from its standard position (order 4 in beacons), which is not allowed by the
         802.11 standard.
        
     17. For which specific conditions does the 802.11 standard
         describe that the NonERPPresent bit should be set in AP
         beacons?
         
         A. 802.11g station associated to the AP

         B. 802.11/802.11b station detected by the AP

         C. 802.11/802.11b station associated to the AP

         D. 802.11/802.11b station authenticated by the AP

         *答案解析*

         C. The standard describes that the NonERPPresent bit should be set by the AP if a non
         802.11g station (that is, 802.11 or 802.11b) is associated to the AP. Many vendors implement
         this bit as soon as the station is detected by the AP, thus extending the standard
         requirements.
         
     18. How do the Supported Rates and Extended Supported Rates
         information elements specify which rates are mandatory
         (basic)?

         A. By setting bit 7 to 1 when basic and 0 when supported

         B. By setting mandatory rates in the Supported Rates IE and
         Supported Rates in the Extended Supported Rates information
         element

         C. By displaying the six basic rates first and then the
         supported rates

         D. The distinction between mandatory and supported is set by
         the 802.11 standard, not by the information elements

         *答案解析*

         A. Each rate is coded over 8 bits (bits 0 to 7), representing a multiple of 500 Kbps. Bit 7 is
         set to 1 when the rate is mandatory and to 0 when the rate is supported. Disabled rates are
         not listed.
    
     19. Which information element describes support for 40 MHz wide
         channels?

         A. The Channel Bonding information element

         B. The HT Extended Channel information element

         C. The HT Frequency Slicing information element

         D. The HT Operation element

         *答案解析*

         D. The HT Operation element describes how 40 MHz channel support is set. The Channel
         Bonding information element, HT Extended Channel information element, and HT Frequency
         Slicing information element do not exist.
      
     20. Which of the following can be identified in an 802.11h
         measurement report frame?

         A. DSSS signals

         B. OFDM signals

         C. FHSS stations

         D. NonERP stations

         *答案解析*

         B. The basic measurement report can identify other neighboring cells (BSS), OFDM signals,
         unidentified signals, or recognized radar signatures (in the sense that a radar matches
         a specific pattern, which 802.11h-compliant stations must recognize). The CCA measurement
         can also simply report the RF activity in the cell.

* CH05 802.11 Control Frames
  控制帧是802.11网络中的“交通警察”， 协助数据帧与管理帧的传送。
** Understanding Control Frames
    control frames do not have a frame body. In addition to the PHY
    and preamble,control frames contain only a layer 2 header and
    trailer. control frames are typically transmitted at one of the
    defined basic rates.

** Carrier Sense
    802.11网络进行数据传输前，需要进行载波监听以判断当前媒介是否处于忙
    碌状态。 载波监听分为虚拟载波监听与物理载波监听 。
*** Virtual Carrier Sense
    #+CAPTION: Virtual carrier sense
    [[./images/2016/2016102501.png]]
    
    The stations that are
    not transmitting listen and hear the Duration/ID, set a countdown timer (NAV), and wait
    until their timer hits 0 before they can contend for the medium and eventually transmit on
    the medium.

    A station cannot contend for the medium until its NAV timer is 0, nor can a
    station transmit on the medium if the NAV timer is set to a
    nonzero value.

*** Physical Carrier Sense
    Physical carrier sensing is performed constantly by all stations that are not transmitting
    or receiving.

    Physical carrier sense has two purposes:
    1. to determine whether a frame transmission is inbound for a
       station to receive.
       If the medium is busy, the radio will attempt to synchronize
       with the transmission. 
    2. to determine whether the medium is busy before transmitting.
       This is known as the clear channel assessment (CCA).

** RTS/CTS Frames
    RTS/CTS是对虚拟载波机制的一个增强。STA在发送数据前，会先向对方发出
    一个RTS请求，周围设备侦听到RTS的STA会重新调整它们的NAV的值。 接收
    方会回一个CTS，周围侦听到CTS的STA也会重新调整它们的NAV的值。这种机
    制有效地避免了相互都不能侦听到对方发送数据的STA之间的访问冲突。 

    #+CAPTION: RTS frame
    [[./images/2016/2016102701.png]]

    #+CAPTION: RTS/CTS Duration values
    [[./images/2016/2016102703.png]]
    
** CTS-to-Self
    CTS-to-self is used strictly as a protection mechanism for
    mixed-mode environments.
    
    #+CAPTION: CTS-to-self frame Duration values
    [[./images/2016/2016102704.png]]

    CTS-to-Self相对来说，开销要小些，但是可能会遇到隐藏结点的问题。 

** Protection Mechanism
    For 802.11g, 802.11b stations, and legacy 802.11 DSSS stations to
    coexist within the same BSS, the 802.11g devices enable what is
    referred to as the protection mechanism, also known as 802.11g
    Protected mode. 

    Many access point vendors offer three confi guration modes for an
    802.11g access point:
    1. 802.11b-Only Mode
       此种模式下，相当于一个802.11b的AP
    2. 802.11g-Only Mode
       APs confi gured as g-only will communicate with only 802.11g
       client     stations using ERP-OFDM technology at data rates of
       6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 Mbps.     Support for DSSS and
       HR-DSSS is disabled;
    3. 802.11b/g Mode
       默认模式，支持DSSS和OFDM。 
    
*** Preventing Collisions
       802.11g设备在发送数据前，会先发送RTS/CTS或CTS-to-self来获得媒介
       访问时间，但是发送这些帧的速率必须是802.11b HR-DSSS设备支持的速
       率，否则这些设备将不能理解接收的数据帧，从而解析不出Duration的
       值出来。 
       
*** ERP Information Element
        ERP IE包含802.11/802.11b的信息，

        #+CAPTION: ERP information element
        [[./images/2016/2016102705.png]]
        The element ID field contains the value 42, which
        identifies the IE as an ERP IE, and the length field contains the value 3. The fields r3 through
        r7 are reserved and set to 0 by default.

        The remaining three fi elds are =NonERP_Present=, =Use_Protection=, and =Barker_Preamble_Mode=
        When a non-ERP station is associated to the BSS, the =Non-ERP_Present= bit is set
        to 1. If one or more associated non-ERP stations are not capable of using short preambles,
        then the =Barker_Preamble_Mode= bit is set to 1.

*** Triggering Protection Mechanism
         802.11g AP来决定是否启用保护机制。它在通过Beacon中的包含ERP
         IE来传达相关信息。 以下几种情况会触发保护机制：
         - an HR-DSSS (802.11b) client association will trigger protection.
         - if an 802.11g AP hears a beacon frame from an 802.11 or
           802.11b access point or ad hoc client, the protection
           mechanism will be triggered.
         - If an ERP AP hears a management frame (other than a probe
           request) where the supported rate includes only 802.11 or
           802.11b rates, the =NonERP_Present= bit may be set to 1.

           How Does 802.11b Affect 802.11g Throughput?
           
           影响原因不是因为切换到802.11b的速率，实际上，ERP之间的无线
           传输仍然是以ERP-OFDM的速率传输的，而是因为在保护模式下，发
           送数据前传送RTS/CTS, CTS-to-self带来的大量的开销。 54Mbps的
           速率通常情况下会提供18~24Mbps的聚合吞吐量。 而一旦开启保护
           模式，虽然STA仍然会以ERP的速率传输数据，但是实际的聚合吞吐
           量则低于13 Mbps甚至低至9 Mbps。 

** Acknowledgement Frame
    802.11速率传输是半双式模式，所以为了确认数据传输成功，每个单播数据
    都要一个确认帧，它有14个字节长。 

    Layer 2 重传率过高是影响WiFi性能的一个重要因素。

** Block Acknowledgement Request
    802.11e 引入了BA机制，将多个确认帧聚合到一个确认帧中，改进了信道传
    输效率。
    
    #+CAPTION: BlockAckReq frame
    [[./images/2016/2016102706.png]]
    
    The Multi-TID and Compressed Bitmap subfields determine whether
    this is a basic Block ACK request, a compressed Block ACK request,
    or a multi-TID Block ACK request.

** Review Questions
    1. ACK and CTS frames follow which interframe space?
       
       A. EIFS

       B. DIFS

       C. PIFS

       D. SIFS

       E. LIFS

       *答案解析*

       D. ACK frames and CTS frames may follow a SIFS. LIFS do not exist.

    2. 802.11 collision detection is handled using which technology?

       A. Network allocation vector (NAV)

       B. Clear channel assessment (CCA)

       C. Duration/ID value

       D. Receiving an ACK from the destination station

       E. Positive collision detection cannot be determined

       *答案解析*

       E. 802.11 technology does not use collision detection. If an ACK frame is not received by
       the original transmitting radio, the unicast frame is not acknowledged and will have to be
       retransmitted. This process does not specifically determine whether a collision occurs. Failure
       to receive an ACK frame from the receiver means that either a unicast frame was not received
       by the destination station or the ACK frame was not received, but it cannot positively determine
       the cause. It may be because of collision or other reasons such as a high noise level. All
       of the other options are used to help avoid collisions.
     
    3. What would cause an 802.11 station to retransmit a unicast
       frame? (Choose all that apply.)

       A. The transmitted unicast frame was corrupted.

       B. The ACK frame from the receiver was corrupted.

       C. The receiving station was set to PCF mode.

       D. The transmitting station will attempt to retransmit the data
       frame.

       E. The transmitting station will send a retransmit
       notification.

       *答案解析*

       A, B. The receiving station may have received the data, but the returning ACK frame may
       have become corrupted, and the original unicast frame will have to be retransmitted. If the
       unicast frame becomes corrupted for any reason, the receiving station will not send an ACK.

    4. A station has enabled protection mechanism and has to enable
       RTS/CTS to provide NAV reservation. During this process, which
       of the following frames are transmitted by the station? (Choose
       all that apply.)

       A. RTS

       B. CTS

       C. DATA

       D. SIFS

       E. ACK

       *答案解析*

       A, C. During the RTS/CTS process, the transmitting station will first transmit the RTS.
       After a SIFS, the intended recipient of the frame will transmit a CTS. After another SIFS,
       the station will transmit the data frame, and then following another SIFS, the intended
       recipient will transmit an ACK if the frame was received correctly.
     
    5. When Power Save mode is enabled, the station uses the TBTT to
       determine when to awaken so that it can listen for the __
       frame, specifically looking to see whether its __ is set in the
       __ field.

       A. Data, AID, TIM

       B. Data, AID, ATIM

       C. Beacon, AID, TIM

       D. Beacon, AID, ATIM

       E. Beacon, SID, TIM

       F. Data, SID, TIM

       *答案解析*

       C. When Power Save mode is enabled, the station uses the Target Beacon Transmission
       Time along with the Beacon frame’s time stamp to know when to awaken prior to the transmission
       of a Beacon. If the AP has cached frames for the station, it will notify the station by
       indicating the station’s Association ID (AID) in the Traffic Indication Map (TIM) field.
      
    6. While performing a packet analysis, you periodically see some
       CF-End frames along with some CF-End+CF-ACK frames. Why are
       these frames occurring? (Choose all that apply.) 

       A. These are corrupted frames

       B. You are running an IBSS network that has PCF enabled.

       C. You are running a BSS network that has DCF enabled.

       D. These are normal frames in a contention network.

       *答案解析*
       
       A. Contention-free (CF) frames occur if a Point Coordination Function (PCF) network is
       configured; however, to our knowledge, no manufacturers have implemented PCF. If PCF
       were implemented, it would require an AP to operate as the point coordinator, so PCF
       could not operate on an IBSS or ad hoc network. Since no manufacturers have implemented
       PCF, the only way these frames could be displaying in the packet analyzer is if other frames
       are corrupted and are being misidentified as PCF frames.
   
    7. Which of the following are protection mechanisms? (Choose all
       that apply.)

       A. NAV back-off

       B. RTS/CTS

       C. RTS-to-self

       D. CTS-to-self

       E. WEP encryption

       *答案解析*
       
       B, D. RTS/CTS and CTS-to-Self provide 802.11g protection mechanisms, sometimes
       referred to as mixed-mode support. NAV back-off and RTS-to-Self do not exist. WEP
       encryption provides data security.
   
    8. Control frames contain which of the following components?
       (Choose all that apply.)

       A. Layer 2 header

       B. Layer 3 header

       C. Layer 2 trailer

       D. Layer 3 trailer

       E. Frame body

       F. Data

       *答案解析*

       A, C. Unlike management and data frames, control frames contain only a layer 2 header
       and trailer.

    9. The Type and Subtype fields are used to identify the function
       of the frame. The Type field is __ bits long, and the Subtype
       field is __ bits long.

       A. 2, 2

       B. 2, 4

       C. 4, 4

       D. 4, 8

       E. 8, 8

       *答案解析*

       B. In any frame, the Type field is 2 bits long and identifies whether the frame is a data
       frame, management frame, or control frame. The Subtype field is 4 bits long.

    10. During a packet capture, you see that the =Barker_Preamble_Mode=
        bit of the ERP information element is set to 1. What is the
        likely cause? 

        A. All nodes support ERP.

        B. A station is not capable of using short preambles.

        C. This is a setting that was manually configured on the AP.

        D. A station is only capable of complementary code keying.

        E. This is the default setting.

        *答案解析*

        B, C. If one or more associated NonERP stations are not capable of using short preambles,
        then the Barker_Preamble_Mode bit is set to 1. This is a setting that can also be manually
        set on many access points.

    11. Which field in the MAC header of an 802.11 frame resets the
        NAV timer for all listening 802.11 stations?

        A. NAV

        B. Frame control

        C. Duration/ID

        D. Sequence number

        E. Strictly ordered bit

        *答案解析*

        C. When the listening radio hears a frame transmission from another station, it looks at
        the header of the frame and determines whether the Duration/ID field contains a Duration
        value or an ID value. If the field contains a Duration value, the listening station will set its
        NAV timer to this value.
        
    12. Prior to using the Block ACK mechanism to transmit QoS data,
        which of the following is true? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. The station must first check to see whether the peer
        station is capable of performing the Block ACK mechanism.

        B. All stations are capable of performing Block ACK, so no
        validation is required.

        C. Notify the station of the QoS mode being used.

        D. Block ACK cannot be used with QoS data.

        *答案解析*

        A. When a station intends to use the Block ACK mechanism, it must first check to see
        whether the peer station is capable of performing the Block ACK mechanism.

    13. A station is operating in a mixed-mode environment and is
        using RTS/CTS to perform NAV distribution. Assuming that the
        station is not using block acknowledgements, when the station
        transmits the RTS frame, the Duration field will include the
        time necessary for which of the following to occur? (Choose
        all that apply.)

        A. One SIFS

        B. Two SIFS

        C. Three SIFS

        D. RTS transmission

        E. CTS transmission

        F. ACK transmission

        G. Data transmission

        *答案解析*

        C, E, F, G. When RTS/CTS is enabled, the RTS frame performs a NAV distribution by setting
        its Duration field to the time it will take for the following to occur, in this order: SIFS,
        CTS transmission, SIFS, Data transmission, SIFS, ACK transmission.

    14. What are the two reasons that 802.11 radios use physical
        carrier sense? (Choose two.)

        A. Synchronize incoming transmissions

        B. Synchronize outgoing transmissions

        C. Reset the NAV

        D. Start the random back-off timer

        E. Assess the RF medium

        *答案解析*

        A, E. The first purpose is to determine whether a frame transmission is inbound for a station
        to receive. If the medium is busy, the radio will attempt to synchronize with the transmission.
        The second purpose is to determine whether the medium is busy before transmitting. This
        is known as the clear channel assessment (CCA). The CCA involves listening for 802.11 RF
        transmissions at the Physical layer. The medium must be clear before a station can transmit.

    15. The presence of what type of transmissions can trigger the
        protection mechanism within an ERP basic service set? (Choose
        all that apply.) 

        A. Association of an HR-DSSS client

        B. Association of an ERP-OFDM client

        C. HR-DSSS beacon frame

        D. ERP beacon frame with the NonERP Present bit set to 1

        E. Association of an FHSS client

        *答案解析*

        A, C, D. An ERP access point signals for the use of the protection mechanism in the ERP
        information element in the beacon frame. Three scenarios can trigger protection in an ERP
        basic service set. If a non-ERP STA associates to an ERP AP, the ERP AP will enable the
        NonERP_Present bit in its own beacons, enabling protection mechanisms in its BSS. In other
        words, an HR-DSSS (802.11b) client association will trigger protection. If an ERP AP hears a
        beacon with an 802.11b or 802.11 supported rate set from another AP or an IBSS STA, it will
        enable the =NonERP_Present= bit in its own beacons, enabling protection mechanisms in its
        BSS. If an ERP AP hears a beacon from another ERP access point with the =NonERP_Present=
        bit set to 1, it also will enable protection mechanisms in its BSS.
      
    16. Which of the following frames will receive an acknowledgment
        if the transmission is successful? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. Simulcast frames

        B. Multicast frames

        C. Broadcast frames

        D. Unicast frames

        *答案解析*

        D. Only Unicast frames will be acknowledged.

    17. While performing a packet analysis, after the data transfer is
        complete, you notice that you captured three data frames and
        two ACKs. Which of the following can explain this capture?
        (Choose all that apply.) 

        A. One of the ACKs is providing a block acknowledgment for two
        data frames.

        B. One of the frames was not received properly, so there was
        no ACK.

        C. All frames were received properly; however, for some reason
        the packet analyzer did not hear the third ACK.

        D. There is not enough information to explain this occurrence.

        E. This is a normal packet capture.

        *答案解析*

        B, C. Every data frame needs to receive an ACK to acknowledge that the data was received
        properly. Since there are three data frames, there should be three ACKs. One possible reason
        is the one of these data frames was not successfully received by the intended recipient;
        therefore, there is no ACK. The other possible reason is that all of the data frames were successfully
        received and acknowledged. However, the station that was performing the packet
        analysis did not hear one of the ACKs.
    
    18. A station is participating in a mixed-mode network and wants
        to transmit data. The station is configured to use CTS-to-self
        as its protection mechanism. Which of the following frames are
        transmitted by the station? (Choose all that apply.) 

        A. RTS

        B. CTS

        C. Data

        D. ACK
        
        E. SIFs

        *答案解析*

        B, C. When CTS-to-self is enabled, the transmitting station will transmit a CTS, wait for
        a SIFS, and then transmit the data frame. If the frame is received correctly, after another
        SIFS, the receiving station will transmit an ACK.
    
    19. ACKs are required for which of the following frames?

        A. Unicast

        B. Broadcast

        C. Multicast

        D. Simulcast

        *答案解析*

        A. All unicast 802.11 frames must be acknowledged. Broadcast and multicast frames do
        not require an acknowledgement. Simulcast frames do not exist.

    20. During a basic RTS/CTS transmission, when a station sends. an
        RTS, the Duration/ID field notifies the other stations that
        they must set their NAV timers to which of the following
        values? 

        A. 213 microseconds

        B. The time necessary to transmit the DATA and ACK frames,
        along with one SIFS

        C. The time necessary to transmit the CTS frame

        D. The time necessary to transmit the CTS, DATA, and ACK
        frames, along with three SIFS

        *答案解析*

        D. When the RTS frame is sent, the value of the Duration/ID field is equal to the time necessary
        for the CTS, DATA, and ACK frames to be transmitted, along with a SIFS before
        each of these frames.

     there is actually a pattern or system to the Subtype bits, with each of the individual bits
     having a specific meaning. By changing bit 4 (b4) from a 0 to a 1, the data subtype includes
     +CF-Ack. Changing bit 5 (b5) from a 0 to a 1 will include +CF-Poll. Changing bit 6 (b6) from
     a 0 to a 1 will indicate that the frame contains no data, specifically, that it contains no Frame
     Body field. The most significant bit (MSB) of the Subtype field (bit b7) is defined as the quality
     of service (QoS) subfield, specifying that the frame is a QoS data frame. This pattern or
     system applies to all subtypes except for 1101, which is Reserved.

** QoS and Non-QoS Data Frames
     具有QoS能力的STA即可以传输QoS数据帧，也可以传输Non-Qos数据帧。 当
     传输QoS数据帧时， 帧控制中的QoS子字段（bit7)为1， 且在帧的头部中
     包含一个QoS控制域。

** Data-carrying versus non-data-carrying frames
    几乎一半的数据帧并没有携带数据，其中真正携带数据的数据帧有：
    - Data (simple data frame)
    - Data + CF-Ack
    - Data + CF-Poll
    - Data + CF-Ack + CF-Poll
    - QoS Data
    - QoS Data + CF-Ack
    - QoS Data + CF-Poll
    - QoS Data + CF-Ack + CF-Poll

      
    实际上并没有携带任何数据的数据帧 有： 
    - Null
    - CF-Ack
    - CF-Poll
    - CF-Ack + CF-Poll
    - Qos Null
    - QoS CF-Poll
    - QoS CF-Ack + CF-Poll


    这些没有携带任何数据的数据帧主要用于传达特殊的控制信息到AP或另外的
    STA。 

** Simple data frames
    普通的数据帧，一般携带的上层协议数据MSDU，当上报给上层时，MSDU通常
    会被转换为802.3数据帧格式。

** Fragmentation
    在干扰比较严重的时候，使用分片机制，可以降低重传的开销。但是，在干
    扰不是很严重的情况下，分片机制会导致传输开销变大，反而会降低吞吐量。 

    
** Data frame aggregation
    
    #+CAPTION: A-MSDU frame aggregation
    [[./images/2016/2016110202.png]]

    There are some restrictions for aggregating multiple MSDUs into
    a single MPDU. The MPDU can only contain MSDUs where the DA and SA values map to the
    same RA and TA values. All of the MSDUs must also have the same
    priority value.

    #+CAPTION: A-MPDU frame aggregation
    [[./images/2016/2016110203.png]]

    The individual MPDUs within an
    A-MPDU must all have the same receiver address. Also, the individual MPDUs must
    all be of the same 802.11e QoS access category. A-MPDU also requires the use of block
    acknowledgments.
    
** Rate Selection
*** Multirate support
        Every wireless adapter has defined minimum received signal and
        minimum SNR levels.

*** Basic rates
         协议标准中定义了基本速率集，每个STA或AP都必须支持。此外，还可
         以支持基本速率集之外的一些速率 。

*** Dynamic rate selection
         随着AP与STA之间的距离发生变化，它们之间传输数据使用的速率也会
         动态变化。 一般来讲，当两者距离增加时，速率会逐渐降低。

** Review Questions
    1. In the data subtype field, by changing the bits b7–b4 from a
       binary 0 to a binary 1, which of the following will be added to
       the basic data frame? (Choose all that apply.) 
       
       A. +CF-Ack

       B. (no data)

       C. +CF-Poll

       D. +ToS

       E. QoS

       *答案解析*

       A, B, C, E. The basic data frame is represented by a Subtype of 0 (bits b7–b4 = 0000). By
       changing any of these Subtype bits, a modification is made to the basic data frame. Most
       people are not aware that there is actually a pattern or system to the Subtype bits, with each
       of the individual bits having a specific meaning. By changing bit 4 (b4) from a 0 to a 1, the
       data subtype includes +CF-Ack. Changing bit 5 (b5) from a 0 to a 1 will include +CF-Poll.
       Changing bit 6 (b6) from a 0 to a 1 will indicate that the frame contains no data, specifically,
       that it contains no Frame Body field. The most significant bit (MSB) of the Subtype
       field (bit b7) is defined as the quality of service (QoS) subfield, specifying that the frame is
       a QoS data frame. This pattern or system applies to all subtypes except for 1101, which
       is Reserved. +ToS does not exist.
      
    2. When a station transmits a multicast frame, what type of data
       frame subtype is used?

       A. Non-QoS frame always

       B. QoS frame always

       C. Non-Qos frame unless the transmitting station knows that all
       stations in the BSS are QoS capable, in which case a QoS frame
       would be used

       D. Two multicast frames are transmitted, one QoS and one
       non-QoS

       E. Non-QoS frame unless the transmitting station knows that all
       stations in the BSS that are members of the multicast group are
       QoS capable, in which case a QoS Frame would be used.

       *答案解析*

       E. If the transmitting station knows that all stations in the
       BSS that are members of the multicast group are QoS capable, it
       will send a QoS frame. If the transmitting station were sending
       a broadcast frame, then it would send a QoS frame if it knew
       all stations in the BSS are QoS capable. A QoS station would
       send a unicast frame only to another QoS station. All other
       transmissions would be non-QoS. 

    3. Which of the following data frames carry data?

       A. Data

       B. CF-Ack

       C. CF-Ack + CF-Poll

       D. QoS Null

       E. QoS CF-Ack + CF-Poll

       *答案解析*

       A. The only one of these frames that actually carries data is
       the data frame, also commonly referred to as the simple data
       frame. The names of all the frames that carry data begin with
       either Data or QoS Data. 

    4. When transmitting a data frame, the values of the To DS and
       From DS fields designate the contents of the address
       fields. During a packet capture of a wireless bridge, what are
       the values of these fields?

       A. To DS = 0, From DS = 0

       B. To DS = 0, From DS = 1

       C. To DS = 1, From DS = 0

       D. To DS = 1, From DS = 1

       E. Not enough information to determine the values

       *答案解析*

       D. A wireless bridge connection is also referred to as a
       wireless distribution system. In this case, both the To DS and
       From DS bits are set to 1. 

    5. When looking at a packet capture, which of the following
       address field statements is false?

       A. The receiver address is always Address 1.

       B. The transmission address is always Address 2.

       C. Address 3 is always the BSSID when the frame is an A-MSDU
       frame.

       D. Address 4 is the source address when both the To DS and From
       DS fields are 1.

       E. The source address is always Address 4.

       *答案解析*

       E. Address 4 is used only when the To DS and From DS bits
       are 1. Address 1 is always the receiver address, and Address 2
       is always the transmission address. 

    6. Frame aggregation allows multiple smaller pieces of data to be
       grouped together into a single frame, reducing the amount of
       overhead. With the 802.11n amendment, two types of frame
       aggregation were added. What are the two types? (Choose all
       that apply.)

       A. A-PPDU

       B. A-PLCP
    
       C. A-MSDU
    
       D. A-MPDU
    
       E. A-MMDU

       *答案解析*

       C, D. With the ratification of the 802.11n amendment, two types
       of frame aggregation were added to 802.11: aggregate MAC
       service data unit (A-MSDU) and aggregate MAC protocol data unit
       (A-MPDU). Frame aggregation allows multiple smaller MSDUs or
       MPDUs to be grouped together into a single frame, reducing the
       amount of overhead that would have been necessary for each
       individual frame. 

    7. When A-MSDU is used to aggregate frames, which of the following
       is true about encryption?

       A. All of the MSDUs are encrypted together as a single payload.

       B. All of the MPDUs are encrypted together as a single payload.

       C. The MSDUs are encrypted individually, prior to aggregation.

       D. The MPDUs are encrypted individually, prior to aggregation.

       E. A-MSDU does not affect the encryption process.

       *答案解析*

       A. A-MSDU is an aggregation process that combines multiple
       MSDUs within a single MPDU. The network layer passes the MSDUs
       down to the MAC layer. Normally at this point each MSDU would
       be packaged with its own MPDU. With A-MSDU, two or more MSDUs
       are placed in an MPDU, and a single MAC and PHY layer header is
       added to the group of MSDUs. If encryption is enabled, then all
       the MSDUs are encrypted together as a single payload.

    8. A 2.4 GHz access point is configured with basic rates of 5.5
       and 11 Mbps. Which of the following stations could connect to
       this AP? (Choose all that apply.)

       A. 802.11 station
       
       B. 802.11b station
       
       C. 802.11g station
       
       D. 802.11a station
       
       E. 802.11n station

       *答案解析*

       B, C, E. Since the AP is a 2.4 GHz device, the 802.11a station
       could not connect. Since 802.11 supports only 1 and 2 Mbps,
       that station could not connect. The basic rate is required in
       order to connect to the network. Since 802.11b, 802.11g, and
       802.11n are all capable of transmitting at 5.5 and 11 Mbps,
       they can connect. 

    9. When referring strictly to the Point Coordination Function
       (PCF) media access method, which of the following terms do not
       apply? (Choose all that apply.) 

       A. Polling
       
       B. Contention-free period (CFP)
       
       C. Contention free (CF)
       
       D. CSMA/CD

       *答案解析*

       D. PCF is a central polling method that provides
       contention-free access. CSMA/CD is a contention method used by
       wired Ethernet. 

    10. A-MSDU is being used for frame aggregation. Which of the
        following statements is true for this process? (Choose all
        that apply.) 

        A. Two or more MSDUs are placed in an MPDU.

        B. The MPDU can only contain MSDUs that have DA and SA values
        that map to the same RA and TA values.

        C. If encryption is enabled, the MSDUs are encrypted together
        as a single payload.

        D. A single MAC and PHY layer header is added to the group of
        MSDUs.

        E. The MSDUs can have different priority values.

        *答案解析*

        A, B, C, D. With A-MSDU, two or more MSDUs are placed in an
        MPDU, and a single MAC and PHY layer header is added to the
        group of MSDUs. If encryption is enabled, then all the MSDUs
        are encrypted together as a single payload. There are some
        restrictions for aggregating multiple MSDUs into a single
        MPDU. The MPDU can only contain MSDUs that have DA and SA
        values that map to the same RA and TA values. All of the MSDUs
        must also have the same priority value. 

    11. Which of the following statements is false regarding quality
        of service (QoS) stations?

        A. When a QoS data frame is transmitted, the frame contains a
        QoS Control field in the MAC header.

        B. When a non-QoS data frame is transmitted, the QoS Control
        field in the MAC header is empty.

        C. When a QoS data frame is transmitted, the QoS subfield
        contains a value of 1.

        D. QoS stations are capable of transmitting both QoS and
        non-QoS data frames.

        E. It is likely that QoS devices will transmit both QoS and
        non-QoS data frames in a mixed environment.

        *答案解析*
        
        B. Quality of service (QoS) stations are capable of
        transmitting both QoS and non-QoS data frames. It is not
        uncommon to have a wireless network that consists of both QoS
        and non-QoS stations. In this type of mixed environment, it is
        likely that QoS devices will transmit both QoS data frames and
        non-QoS data frames depending upon the capabilities of the
        receiving station. When a QoS data frame is transmitted, the
        QoS subfield (the b7 bit) contains a value of 1, and the frame
        contains a QoS Control field in the MAC header. When a non-QoS
        data frame is transmitted, the QoS subfield (the b7 bit)
        contains a value of 0, and the QoS Control field is not
        present in the MAC header. 

    12. A wireless 802.11g adapter supports multiple data rates, with
        the manufacturer specifications showing a minimum received
        signal of -73 dBm for the 36 Mbps data rate and a minimum
        signal-to-noise ratio of 18 dB. For the 54 Mbps data rate,
        which of the following are likely values? (Choose all that
        apply.) 

        A. -71 dBm minimum received signal

        B. -77 dBm minimum received signal

        C. 12 dB minimum signal-to-noise ratio

        D. 25 dB minimum signal-to-noise ratio

        *答案解析*

        A,D. Since 54 Mbps is a faster data rate than the 36 Mbps,
        then the minimum received signal needs to be stronger, and the
        difference between the signal and the noise needs to be greater.

    13. Which of the following are other terms used for dynamic rate
        selection? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. Dynamic rate shifting

        B. Fast rate selection

        C. Adaptive rate selection

        D. Automatic rate selection

        *答案解析*

        A, C, D. DRS is also referred to as dynamic rate shifting,
        adaptive rate selection, and automatic rate selection. All
        these terms refer to a method of speed fallback on a wireless
        LAN client as signal quality from the access point decreases. 

    14. During the packet capture of a frame from an AP to a station,
        which of the following statements about the frame header are
        true if the frame payload originated from a wired-side server?
        (Choose all that apply.)

        A. To DS = 1, From DS = 0

        B. Address 1 = RA = DA

        C. Address 2 = TA = BSSID

        D. Address 3 = SA

        E. Address 4 = BSSID

        *答案解析*

        B, C, D. To begin with, Address 1 is always the receiver
        address, and Address 2 is always the transmitter address. When
        the frame is transmitted from an AP to a station, the To DS
        and From DS bits are 01. In this case, the transmitter address
        is also the address of the BSSID, so Address 2 is also the
        BSSID address. Since the source of this frame is the AP, then
        the receiver address and the destination address are the same
        in Address 1. Address 3 is thus set to the source address, and
        Address 4 is not used. 

    15. Which of the following is true regarding dynamic rate
        switching? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. The algorithms used are proprietary and defined by the
        radio card manufacturers.

        B. The 802.11 standard defines limits for when to switch
        between different rates.

        C. Most vendors base switching upon RSSI thresholds, packet
        error rates, and retransmissions.

        D. Strict adherence to the 802.11 rate selection algorithms
        provides consistent roaming across devices.

        *答案解析*

        A, C. Since the 802.11-2007 standard does not define any
        specific rate selection algorithm, the algorithms used for
        dynamic rate switching are proprietary and are defined by
        radio card manufacturers. Most vendors base DRS on receive
        signal strength indicator (RSSI) thresholds, packet error
        rates, and retransmissions. RSSI metrics are usually based on
        signal strength and signal quality. In other words, a station
        might shift up or down between data rates based both on
        received signal strength in dBm and possibly on a
        signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) value. Because vendors implement
        DRS differently, you may have two different vendor client
        cards at the same location, while one is communicating with
        the access point at 65 Mbps and the other is communicating at
        6 Mbps. 

    16. A-MSDU is being used for frame aggregation. Which of the
        following statements is true for this process? (Choose all
        that apply.)

        A. Two or more MPDUs are placed in a single PPDU.

        B. An MPDU is created for each MSDU.

        C. If encryption is enabled, each MPDU is encrypted
        individually.

        D. The individual MPDUs must all be of the same 802.11e QoS
        access category.

        E. Each A-MPDU will receive an ACK.

        *答案解析*
        
        A, B, C, D. A-MPDU is an aggregation process that combines
        multiple MPDUs within a single PPDU. The network layer passes
        the MSDUs down to the MAC layer, where an MPDU is created for
        each MSDU. If encryption is enabled, then each MPDU is
        encrypted individually. The MPDUs are then passed down to the
        PLCP sublayer where two or more MPDUs are placed in a single
        PPDU. The individual MPDUs within an A-MPDU must all have the
        same receiver address. Also, the individual MPDUs must all be
        of the same 802.11e quality-of-service access category. A-MPDU
        also requires the use of block acknowledgments.

    17. When A-MSDU is used to aggregate frames, which of the
        following is true about encryption?

        A. All of the MSDUs are encrypted together as a single
        payload.

        B. All of the MPDUs are encrypted together as a single
        payload.

        C. The MSDUs are encrypted individually, prior to aggregation.

        D. The MPDUs are encrypted individually, prior to aggregation.

        E. A-MSDU does not affect the encryption process.

        *答案解析*

        A. A-MPDU is an aggregation process that combines multiple
        MPDUs within a single PPDU. The network layer passes the MSDUs
        down to the MAC layer, where an MPDU is created for each
        MSDU. If encryption is enabled, then each MPDU is encrypted
        individually. 

    18. For the MSDU or MMPDU fragments to be reassembled, which of
        the following must be contained in the header of the
        fragmented frames? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. Frame type
        
        B. Address of the sender

        C. Destination address

        D. Sequence Control field

        E. More Fragments indicator

        *答案解析*

        A, B, C, D, E. The header must contain all this
        information. The Sequence Control field is actually made up of
        two pieces, the sequence number and the fragment number. The
        sequence number within this field remains the same for all
        fragments from the same MSDU or MPDU, while the fragment
        number within this field is incremented for each individual
        fragment. 

    19. During a packet capture, you notice that there is a series of
        fragmented frames. These frame fragments can contain what type
        of frames? 

        A. Broadcast
        
        B. Multicast

        C. Anycast

        D. Unicast

        E. All of the above

        *答案解析*

        D. The 802.11-2007 standard allows for the fragmentation of unicast addressed frames.

    20. When the To DS bit is 1 and the From DS bit is 0, what is the
        value of the Address 1 field?

        A. Receiver address
        
        B. Transmitter address

        C. Destination address

        D. Source address

        E. BSSID

        *答案解析*

        A, E. To begin with, Address 1 is always the receiver address,
        and Address 2 is always the transmitter address. When the To
        DS and From DS bits are 10, then the frame is being sent from
        a station to the distribution system. In this case, the
        receiver address is also the address of the BSSID, so Address
        1 is also the BSSID address. Since the source of this frame is
        the station, then the transmitter address and the source
        address are the same in Address 2. Address 3 is thus set to
        the destination address, and Address 4 is not used. 

* CH07 802.11 Medium Contention

** CSMA/CA

*** Distributed Coordination Function
        对于non-Qo无线网络，CSM/CA使用DCF来竞争媒介。而对于QoS网络，则
        采用hybrid coordination function (HCF)，它使用了enhanced
        distributed channel access (EDCA)。与DCF相比，EDCA主要是增加了
        能区分优先级的参数。它是Wi-Fi Multimedia的核心机制。

        至于 point coordination function (PCF)， HCF使用HCF-controlled
        channel access (HCCA)来竞争媒介，但并未在真实网络上实现。

*** An Example of 802.11 Medium Contention
         There are two carrier sense protocols used by stations to
         indicate whether a channel is busy or idle: 
         - Physical carrier sense, also known as the clear channel
           assessment (CCA)
         - Virtual carrier sense, also known as the network allocation
           vector (NAV) 
           
** Interframe Spaces
     不同的帧间间隔主要用来差异化媒介的访问。它们的使用规则如下：
     - If the arbitration has been completed, t NN hen a reduced IFS
       (RIFS) or short IFS (SIFS) will be used. In most cases, the
       SIFS is used. The RIFS is only used between consecutive frames
       transmitted by the same 802.11n device.
     - If arbitration has not been determined, then an arbitration IFS
       (AIFS) or DCF IFS (DIFS) will be used. The AIFS is used for
       WLANs that support 802.11e QoS, and the DIFS is used for WLANs
       that do not support 802.11e QoS.
     - If an AP or station has received a corrupted frame—as defined
       by having an incorrect frame check sequence (FCS)—then an
       extended IFS (EIFS) will be used.
     - The PCF IFS (PIFS) is part of PCF and therefore not used in the
       real world. 
     
*** SIFS
        SIFS是其他IFS的基础，它设置为一个静态的长度，它的长度用于决定
        其他IFS的长度。根据不同的WLAN类型，SIFS可能会被设置成10ms或
        16ms。 对于2.4G下的802.11b/g/n设务，SIFS的值为10ms。 对于5G下
        的802.11a/n设备，SIFS的值为16ms。

        SIFS是一个使用比较普遍的IFS，它问题用于Arbitration完成后。例外
        是，当802.11n设备正在使用MIMO传输数据，且传输的数据属于某次次
        CFB(contention-free burst)的一部分，那么就会使用RIFS。

*** RIFS
        RIFS的长度总是2ms。 只用于使用MIMO传输的802.11n设备，它只在数
        据帧前面使用。

*** DIFS
        对于non-QoS设备，一般在arbitration完成之前使用。它的时间长度等
        于 2*SIFS + 2 * slot times.
        
        对于 802.11a/n , 5G下，slot time的长度为9ms。 
        对于802.11g/n, 2.4G下，且使用了HT或ERP，slot time的长度为9ms。
        对于802.11a/g/n，2.4G下，使用DSSS物理层，slot time的长度为20ms。
        当使用长前导码的情况下，开启HT或ERP，则slot time的长度为20ms。
        802.11 FHSS使用的slot time为50ms，但从来没有实现过。

*** EIFS
        当检测到Corrupted的帧后，会使用EIFS。

*** PIFS
        等于 1 slot time + 1 SIFS。 用于给AP提供机会发送Beacon来开启一
        次CFP。 PIFS比DIFS短。

        在现实生活中，PIFS只用于Channel Switch Announcement，它是
        802.11h定义的一个Action帧， PIFS使其在Arbitration结束后，马上
        进行传输。

** Random Backoff
     在IFS时间结束后，在传输数据之间，需要进行一次退避算法，退避时间一
     般是slot time的整数倍，它的最小值是0，最大值是CW，当传输帧发生错
     误时，CW会增大，但是有上限，不同类型的网络上限会有些区别 。
     
** Frame Transmission
    发送一包数据，到收到Ack响应，一次传送过程就结束了。然后会开启第二
    次传输，所有的STA又会进入一个竞争等待的过程，其中上次退避时间没有
    到0的会从上次退避时间开始倒数。
       
** Quality of Service
     802.11e定义了HCF功能作为一个新的信道访问方法来改善DCF和PCF。 HCF
     引入了两种信道访问方法：
     - HCF controlled channel access(HCCA)
       Designed to be an improvement for contention-free access (specifically, PCF)
     - Enhanced distributed channel access(EDCA)
       Designed to be an improvement for contention-based access
       (specifically, DCF) 

     QoS BSS划分了4种访问类型，提供访问信道的不同优先级，优先级从高到
     低依次为： voice, video, best effort, and background. 总体来说，
     对媒介竞争访问的修改主要在如下几点：
     - IFS
       An AIFS is used instead of a DIFS.
     - CW
       Different access categories are assigned different CW values.
     - Frame transmission
       A transmit opportunity (TXOP) is allocated rather than allowing
       a single frame.

*** AIFS
        802.11e网络下代替DIFS。 AIFS不是静态值，它等于一个SIFS以及可变
        的slot time。不同的优先级传输slot time的数量不一样。slot time
        的数量也称为arbitration interframe space number (AIFSN). 默认
        情况下，不同类别的AIFS的长度值如下：
        - voice and video
          two slot times
        - best effort
          three slot times
        - background
          seven slot times

*** QoS-Based Random Backoff Timer
         这是另外一种区分优先级的情况。 通过设置不同AC下的CWmin和CWmax
         的值 。

         #+CAPTION: AIFS
         | Access category | Min x | CW Min | Max x | CW Max |
         |-----------------+-------+--------+-------+--------|
         | Voice           |     2 |      3 |     3 |      7 |
         | Video           |     3 |      7 |     4 |     15 |
         | Best effort     |     4 |     15 |    10 |   1023 |
         | Background      |     4 |     15 |    10 | 1023   |
         |-----------------+-------+--------+-------+--------|

         当两个STA传送的数据属于相同的AC时，则与DCF无异。当两个STA传送
         的数据不属于相同的AC时，则与DCF差异明显。

         #+CAPTION: EDCA-based channel access: different ACs
         [[./images/2016/2016110801.png]]

         不过，AC级别低的STA还是有可能先获得媒介的访问权。

*** TXOP
         TXOP Limit是为STA和AP分配的一段时间，在这段时间内，它们可以一
         直占用信道 连续发送数据，而不用竞争信道的访问权(multiple
         frames are transmitted without having arbitration before each
         frame)。

         #+CAPTION: TXOP
         [[./images/2016/2016110802.png]]

         
         802.11e为每种AC定义了默认的TXOP的值 。
         
         #+CAPTION: Default TXOP limits
         | Access category | DSSS (b,g,n) | OFDM (a,g,n) TXOP |

         |-----------------+--------------+-------------------|
         
** 802.11n
      802.11n adds two features to channel access that improve the
      efficiency of the data/acknowledgment process: the RIFS and the
      block acknowledgment. 
      
*** Block Acknowledgments
        The block acknowledgment process is designed to make TXOPs
        more efficient. 

        By adding the block acknowledgment, 802.11n stations are able
        to transmit larger numbers of data frames within a TXOP.

        In the real world, the block acknowledgment is used in a
        different way.
        1. TXOP rarely used.  even when the TXOP is used, stations and
           APs almost never have more than one frame ready for
           transmission at any given moment.

** Review Questions
    
    1. Which coordination function is an optional method that is not
       used in real-world 802.11 APs?
       
       A. ACF mode

       B. DCF mode

       C. ECF mode

       D. PCF mode

       *答案解析*

       D. PCF mode is the coordination function that involves the AP
       taking control of the BSS at regular intervals in order to
       regulate channel access. It is optional in the 802.11 standard
       and unavailable in APs. DCF mode is the coordination function
       that involves all 802.11 devices—APs and stations—arbitrating
       equally for channel access. It is required in the 802.11
       standard. ACF mode and ECF mode are not 802.11 coordination
       functions. 

    2. Which of the following will cause a 2.4 GHz 802.11n station to
       stay quiet even though it has data ready to be transmitted?

       A. An 802.11b station from a nearby BSS is transmitting a data
       frame, and the received signal is above the ED threshold.

       B. An 802.11b station associated to the same BSS is
       transmitting a data frame, and the received signal is below the
       ED threshold. 

       C. A Bluetooth pairing has been made and detected on the
       channel by the AP.

       D. The 2.4 GHz 802.11n station has just chosen zero slot times
       in the random backoff timer.

       *答案解析*

       A. APs and stations stay quiet because of the CCA being set to
       Busy whenever another 802.11 transmission is detected above the
       ED threshold. In the case of a 2.4 GHz 802.11n station, that
       means an 802.11b, 802.11g, or 802.11n frame transmission
       received above the ED threshold will cause the CCA to be set to
       Busy, no matter which BSS the frame emanates from. If frames
       are received at a signal below the ED threshold, then stations
       set the CCA to Idle and frames may be transmitted. Bluetooth
       transmissions will not set the CCA to Idle in 802.11
       stations. When zero slot times have been chosen in the random
       backoff timer, an 802.11 device immediately transmits a frame.

    3. Which IFS is used only in between frame transmissions by the
       same AP or station?

       A. AIFS

       B. EIFS
       
       C. RIFS

       D. SIFS

       *答案解析*

       C. The RIFS, which was introduced with 802.11n, is used
       exclusively between frames transmitted during a single CFB. A
       single CFB is always transmitted by a single station. The AIFS
       and EIFS are used exclusively between frames transmitted by
       different stations. The SIFS may be used during a CFB, but it
       may also be used prior to an acknowledgment, which would place
       it between frames transmitted by different stations. 

    4. When an 802.11n station begins the arbitration process after a
       failed frame transmission, which IFS is used?

       A. AIFS
       
       B. DIFS

       C. EIFS

       D. SIFS

       *答案解析*

       A. Even if the previous frame transmission failed, 802.11n
       stations will always use the AIFS during arbitration. DIFS is
       used during the arbitration process for 802.11a/b/g stations
       that are not using 802.11e QoS if the previous frame seen on
       the channel was not corrupted. EIFS is used only if the
       previous frame transmission on the channel was received as
       corrupted. This is the case for all 802.11a/b/g/n
       stations. SIFS is never used during arbitration. 

    5. Which two access categories use the same default AIFSN values
       by default? (Choose two.)

       A. Voice
       
       B. Video

       C. Best effort

       D. Background

       *答案解析*

       A, B. The voice and video access categories both have default
       AIFSN values of 2. The best effort access category has a default
       AIFSN value of 3. The background access category has a default
       AIFSN value of 7. 

    6. Which two access categories use the same default CW values by
       default?

       A. Voice

       B. Video

       C. Best effort

       D. Background

       *答案解析*
       
       C, D. The best-effort and background access categories both
       have default CWmin values of 15 and default CWmax values
       of 1023. The voice access category has a default CWmin value of
       3 and a default CWmax value of 7. The video access category has
       a default CWmin value of 7 and a default CWmax value of 15. 

    7. An AP without RTS/CTS enabled, a station with an RTS/CTS
       enabled, and a station with RTS/CTS disabled all have a data
       frame ready to be transmitted as part of the same BSS. Which
       device will transmit first? 

       A. The station with RTS/CTS enabled will always transmit first.

       B. The AP will always transmit first.

       C. The station without RTS/CTS enabled will be allowed to
       transmit first only if it chooses the lowest slot time during
       the random backoff timer. 

       D. The station with RTS/CTS enabled will be allowed to transmit
       first only if it chooses the highest number of slot times
       during the random backoff timer.

       *答案解析*

       C. The station or AP that has the lowest amount of time from
       the combination of the IFS and the random backoff timer will
       always transmit first. That means a low number of slot times
       allows a station to transmit first. RTS/CTS settings do not
       affect which station or AP will gain access to the channel
       first when multiple devices have data ready to transmit. APs do
       not have priority over stations when accessing the wireless
       channel. 

    8. In a mixed mode 5 GHz WLAN, which of the following devices
       would transmit first?

       A. An 802.11n AP with a beacon frame to transmit after choosing
       two slot times

       B. An 802.11n station with a data frame to transmit after
       choosing one slot time

       C. An 802.11n station with a data frame to send and RTS/CTS
       enabled, no matter what number of slot times are chosen 

       D. An 802.11a station with a data frame to transmit after
       choosing zero slot times

       *答案解析*

       D. The station or AP that chooses the lowest number of slot
       times during the random backoff timer will always transmit
       first. Frame type, 802.11a/b/g/n standards support, and RTS/CTS
       do not affect which station will transmit first when multiple
       stations have data ready to be transmitted.

    9. What is the minimum CWmin value for an 802.11b AP?

       A. 15
       
       B. 16

       C. 31

       D. 32

       *答案解析*

       C. The default CWmin value for 802.11b devices is 31. That is
       the default CWmin value whenever DSSS frame transmissions are
       ready to be sent. The default CWmin value for 802.11a/g/n
       devices is 15. Finally, 16 and 32 are not default CWmin values
       under any circumstance。 

    10. What is the non-QOS CW value for an 802.11g station when it is
        about to transmit its second retry frame to an 802.11n AP?

        A. 63

        B. 64

        C. 127

        D. 128

        *答案解析*

        A. An 802.11g station associated to an 802.11n AP will have a
        default CWmin value of 15. The CW will increase exponentially
        with each retry. On the first retry, the CW value will be 31,
        and on the second retry the CW value will be 63. On the third
        retry from an 802.11g station that is about to transmit to an
        802.11n AP, a CW value of 127 will be used. Finally, 64 and
        128 are not CW values under any circumstances. 

    11. When will an EIFS be used prior to a frame transmission?
        
        A. When a corrupted frame has been received
        
        B. When a station is about to send a retransmitted frame
        
        C. When an 802.11n station is about to transmit on a mixed
        mode 802.11b/g/n or 802.11a/n BSS

        D. When an 802.11a/b/g station is about to transmit on a mixed
        mode 802.11b/g/n or 802.11a/n BSS

        *答案解析*

        A. The EIFS is used only after a corrupted frame has been
        received. When a station has failed to receive an
        acknowledgment after a frame transmission, it sends a
        retransmitted frame. The retransmitted frame will be sent
        after either DIFS (non-QoS) or AIFS (QoS). Distinctions
        between 802.11a/b/g/n do not affect whether the EIFS is used
        prior to a frame transmission.

    12. Which well-known problem is EIFS known to cause?
        
        A. Hidden node

        B. Mixed mode

        C. Near/Far

        D. Protection mechanism

        *答案解析*

        C. Near/Far may be caused by EIFS because successful frame
        transmissions may be seen as corrupted if stations are too far
        from the AP. The hidden node problem is caused by two stations
        or APs that cover the same transmission area but cannot hear
        each other’s transmissions. Mixed mode and protection
        mechanism are not problems. 

    13. Which 802.11e QoS channel access method requires the QoS AP to
        take control of the wireless channel and manage service
        periods for associated stations?

        A. DCF mode
        
        B. PCF mode

        C. HCF mode using EDCA

        D. HCF mode using HCCA

        *答案解析*

        D. HCF mode using HCCA is a QoS-based channel access method
        that involves the AP taking control of the wireless channel in
        order to manage station service periods. DCF mode and HCF mode
        using EDCA do not involve the AP taking control of the
        wireless channel. PCF mode does involve the AP taking control
        of the wireless channel, but it comes from the original 802.11
        standard, not the 80211e QoS amendment. 

    14. Which IFS is used prior to the random backoff timer when a QoS
        AP or station is about to transmit a frame and a corrupted
        frame has just been received? 

        A. AIFS

        B. DIFS
        
        C. EIFS

        D. PIFS

        *答案解析*
        
        C. The EIFS is used prior to frame transmission any time a
        corrupted frame has just been received. The AIFS is used prior
        to frame transmission when data frames are about to be sent by
        QoS devices. The DIFS is used prior to frame transmission when
        data frames are about to be sent by non-QoS devices. The PIFS
        is used by APs to take control of the wireless channel before
        a contention-free period when in PCF mode. 

    15. By default, what is the AIFSN value for the background access
        category?

        A. 2
        
        B. 3

        C. 5

        D. 7

        *答案解析*

        D. The background AC has a default AIFSN value of 7. Higher
        AIFSN values give traffic a lower priority, and background is
        designed to be the lowest-priority AC. Voice and video traffic
        uses an AIFSN value of 2 by default, and best-effort traffic
        uses a default AIFSN value of 3. There is no AC with a default
        AIFSN value of 5. 

    16. By default, what is the minimum CW value for the video access
        category?

        A. 3
        
        B. 7
        
        C. 15

        D. 31

        *答案解析*
        
        B. The default CWmin value for the video AC is 7. That gives
        video traffic a lower priority level than voice traffic (which
        has a default CWmin value of 3) and higher priority than
        besteffort and background traffic (which both have default
        CWmin values of 15). 802.11b stations and APs that do not
        support QoS use the default CWmin value of 31. 

    17. If an AP is configured with the TXOP limit for the voice
        access category left to the default value of 47, how many
        microseconds will the maximum TXOP be for traffic that uses
        the voice access category?
        
        A. 47

        B. 188

        C. 470

        D. 1504

        *答案解析*

        D. The TXOP limit value is multiplied by 32 to determine the
        maximum number of microseconds in a TXOP. Therefore, a TXOP
        limit value of 47 would result in a maximum TXOP of 1504
        microseconds. 

    18. What protocols are required in 802.11n to make TXOPs more
        efficient that are not required in 802.11e? (Choose two.) 

        A. Block acknowledgments

        B. CFB

        C. CWmax

        D. RIFS

        *答案解析*
        
        A, D. Block acknowledgments are optional in 802.11e but
        required in 802.11n. Block acknowledgments make the channel
        more efficient by reducing the number of acknowledgment frames
        on the channel. The RIFS is not part of 802.11e and is
        required in 802.11n. The RIFS is an interframe space of 2
        microseconds, allowing the channel to be more efficient than
        when the SIFS of 10 or 16 microseconds is used. CFBs were
        introduced in 802.11e and are required. CFBs do make the
        channel more efficient by allowing multiple data frames to be
        transmitted without going through arbitration for each
        frame. CWmax was part of the 802.11 standard. A low CWmax
        value could make the wireless channel more efficient because
        large CW values can cause stations to spend a large amount of
        time in the random backoff timer before transmitting a frame.

    19. How many frames will be transmitted within a TXOP if the
        transmitting AP has four frames to send and block
        acknowledgments are not used? 

        A. 4

        B. 6

        C. 8

        D. 10

        *答案解析*

        C. If block acknowledgments are not used, then one
        acknowledgment must be received for every data frame
        sent. That means a total of eight frame transmissions during a
        TXOP that includes a four-frame CFB. If block acknowledgments
        were used, a four-frame CFB would result in six total frames
        being sent during the TXOP. 

    20. How long is the RIFS?

        A. 2 microseconds

        B. 10 microseconds

        C. 16 microseconds

        D. 32 microseconds

        *答案解析*
        
        A. RIFS is 2 microseconds. SIFS is 10 microseconds for 2.4 GHz
        802.11b/g/n devices and 16 microseconds for 5 GHz 802.11a/n
        devices. 

* CH08 Power Management
** Wireless Radios and Battery Life
     一个无线设备会执行如下如下4种活动：
     1. Asleep
     2. Idle and awake
     3. Receiving
     4. Transmitting

     这些活动的耗电量依次变大。802.11省电管理就是要让一个无线设备尽量
     的处于低耗电量的状态下，尽量减少高耗电量的活动，只在必要的时候才
     执行高耗电量的活动(RX & TX)。 另外，也要让 RX & TX执行得更有效率。

*** Power Save Modes
        1. Active Mode
           此状态下STA与AP总是处于准备发送和接收数据的状态。
        2. Power Save Mode
           此状态下STA处于休眠状态下，不能接收数据帧。
           处于此种状态下的STA并不一定一直保持休眠状态, 只是说明AP会认
           为STA处于休眠状态，所以会缓冲发往STA的帧 直到STA发送一个帧
           来向AP请求缓存的数据。

*** Power States
        当一个STA处于Power Save Mode，它会在如下两种状态下之间进行切换：
        - Doze State
          The station is saving the most battery life.
        - Awake State
          The station may either be idle, receiving, or transmitting.

        目前存在有3种802.11省电管理协议，但它们的目标都是一致的：最大
        化Doze State的时间，最小化Awake/Idle的时间。

        任何一种省电管理方法都会遵循如下步骤：
        1. Before a station goes into the doze state, it sends a
           frame, usually a null data frame, to the AP indicating that
           power management is enabled
           
           #+CAPTION: Station sends a null data frame
           [[./images/2016/2016112801.png]]

        2. Once the station indicates that it is in Power Save mode,
           the AP begins to buffer all frames destined to that
           station.

           #+CAPTION: AP buffers data
           [[./images/2016/2016112802.png]]

        3. When the station goes into the awake state (more on that
           later), it sends a frame to the AP in order to begin the
           data retrieval process 

           #+CAPTION: Station retrieves data
           [[./images/2016/2016112803.png]]

        4. When the AP has finished sending all buffered data to the
           station, the station goes back into the doze state

           #+CAPTION: Station returns to the doze state
           [[./images/2016/2016112804.png]]

** Power Management Structure
     到目前为止，在802.11家族中，有三种省电管理方法：
     1. 802.11 power management
        Legacy Method
     2. Unscheduled automatic power save delivery (U-APSD) from the 802.11e amendment
     3. Power save multi-poll (PSMP) from the 802.11n amendment.

*** Association Identifier
        省电管理始于STA与AP关联成功的最后一步。AP返回的Association
        Response会分配一个AID(1~2007)给刚关联上的STA。AID为0时，代表有
        缓存广播帧。
        
        一旦STA获得了AID，就可以进入省电模式了。STA进入省电状态时，通
        常会一个Null数据帧，其中的Power Management位置为1，AP收到该帧
        后，会为该STA缓存数据帧。 当STA处于省电模式后，其行为就与各厂
        商的实现有关。

        STA从休眠状态醒来有三个原因， *第一个原因* 是该STA有帧待传。这
        咱情况下STA会马上醒来并发送帧。发送完成后，它会进入休眠模式或
        者是活跃模式继续发送帧。可通过802.11头部的Power Management位看
        出。

*** Traffic Indication Map
        *第二个原因* 是STA内部的某种机制来唤醒STA。 
        当STA依赖其内部某种机制定期唤醒的时候，它会计算它们的唤醒时间，
        使得在Beacon到达前及时唤醒。因为beacon帧携带了TIM信息列出了哪
        些STA需要向AP请求缓存帧。
        
*** Delivery Traffic Indication Message
         DTIM beacon帧与其他的beacon帧一样，唯一的区别是TIM IE显示的信
         息是关于缓存在AP中的广播/多播帧情况。当一个beacon帧是DTIM
         beacon帧时，如下两个值会受影响：
         - DTIM Count
           This will always be set to 0.
         - Bitmap Control
           使用第一个比特位，如果为1，表示AP有缓存广播/多播帧，为0时，
           代表没有。

** 802.11 Power Management
      如下一些方面，使得802.11省电管理与众
      不同：
      - Stations Stay in Power Save Mode
        在第三步中，STA通过向AP发送一个帧来取数据，其中802.11头部中的
        Power Management位置为1. 

        在第四步中，当取完数据后，STA不用通知AP就可以进入休眠状态，因
        为STA一直处于Power Save模式下。

      - Power Save Poll (PS-Poll) Frames Are Used
        在第三步中，STA向AP发送PS-Poll帧来取数据。
      - Stations Transmit Frames While in Power Save Mode
        STA传输的帧中的Power Management位被置为1. 


      802.11省电管理有如下一些局限：
      1. 增加了无线信道的开销。
         PS-POLL没有包含数据。传输这些帧会降低信道的最大吞吐量。802.11
         省电管理中，要求向AP取每笔数据前，都要先发一个PS-POLL帧。
      2. STA花费了太多时间在传输帧
         STA处于传输状态是最耗电的。由于在取每笔数据前都要先发一个
         PS-POLL帧，增加了传输时间，从而增加了耗电时间。这也是802.11省
         电管理在实际上应用很少的原因。
        
** 802.11e U-APSD
     U-APSD是802.11e修订一部分，也是WMM-Power Save认证中的一部分，同时
     也是802.11n STA必需的功能。 

     整体框架上，U-APSD与802.11省电管理的步骤一样，但有如下一些区别：
     - Stations Vacillate Between Active Mode and Power Save Mode

       在802.11省电管理中，STA始终处于Power Save模式下，只是在Awake和
       Doze状态之间来回在切换。

       在第三步中，通常STA会发送一个Null数据帧向AP取Buffered的数据。
       
       #+CAPTION: Station retrieves data
       [[./images/2016/2016112805.png]]

       在第四步中，STA必须显式地通知AP后，才能进入Doze状态。AP也才会重
       新为STA缓存发送的帧。

       #+CAPTION: Station returns to the doze state
       [[./images/2016/2016112901.png]]

     - PS-Poll Frames Are Not Used
       
       通常使用Null-Data来向AP取数据，并且是一次性取的，不会取一次发一
       次Null-Data。

       U-APSD相对802.11省电管理来说，是一种更高级的省电管理机制，任何
       时候都应该尽量使用它。由于U-APSD是从802.11e修订引进的，现实中大
       量的STA可能并不支持802.11e。 但是许多STA支持U-APSD-esque省电管
       理方法。它们取AP的缓存数据时，都只需要发一次null-data数据帧，差
       异主要体现在AP发送缓存的单播帧时，当使用U-APSD时，之前缓存的数
       据帧是通过一个TXOP来连续发送的，使用较小的SIFS或RIFS(对于
       802.11n设备来说)。而non-802.11e模式下，则必须遵循一般的媒介竞争
       访问机制，帧间传输需要经历一个DIFS时间以及随机退避时间。

       当一个TXOP时间只允许传输一个帧的话，实际上两者之间就是等同的。
     
** 802.11n Power Management
     802.11n设备实际上是使用U-APSD，虽然802.11n省电管理包含了
     PSMP(power save multi-poll)和SMPS(spatial multiplexing power save)。

*** SMPS
        SMPS involves stations reducing the number of data streams
        used during spatial multiplexing. 

*** PSMP
        基于S-APSD之上的一种Power Management方法，主要应用于使用HCCA
        信道访问控制机制的网络 。

** IBSS Power Management
     The basic structure is the same: stations send a notification
     before dozing, and then frames get buffered, and finally the
     dozing stations wake up in order to retrieve their frames. The
     difference is that there is no central AP to buffer the frames,
     and there is no need for a TIM or DTIM. 

     To accommodate the fact that multiple devices may be buffering frames for one dozing
     station, IBSS power management introduces the use of the announcement traffic indication
     message (ATIM) frame.

     When a station receives an ATIM frame, that formerly dozing station must begin the process of
     retrieving buffered frames from the station that transmitted the ATIM.

** Review Questions
    1. Which one of the following 802.11 amendments defined new power
       management methods, involving stations entering the doze state,
       that are used in real-world devices? (Choose all that apply.)
       
       A. 802.11b

       B. 802.11e

       C. 802.11h

       D. 802.11n

       *答案解析*

       B, D. 802.11e defined U-APSD and 802.11n defined unscheduled
       PSMP, which are used in real-world stations and APs that are
       WMM Power Save certified. 802.11b and 802.11h amendments did
       not define new power management methods. 

    2. Which of the following frame types is typically used by
       stations to notify an AP of a change in power management mode? 

       A. Acknowledgment
       
       B. Null data

       C. PS-Poll
       
       D. RTS

       *答案解析*

       B. Null data frames use the power management flag in the 802.11
       header to change between active mode and Power Save
       mode. Acknowledgment and RTS frames do not play a role in power
       management. PS-Poll frames are used in power management, but
       they are typically used to retrieve buffered unicast frames
       from the AP, not to notify the AP of a change in power state.

    3. Which of the following states drains the most battery life?

       A. Doze

       B. Idle

       C. Receive

       D. Transmit

       *答案解析*
       
       D. The transmit state drains the most battery life. The receive
       state drains the second-most battery life, idle drains the
       third most, and doze drains the least battery life. 

    4. Which of the following states drains the least battery life?
       
       A. Doze

       B. Idle

       C. Receive

       D. Transmit

       *答案解析*

       A. The doze state drains the least battery life. The idle state
       drains the second-least battery life, receive drains the third
       most, and transmit drains the most battery life. 

    5. Which power management method uses the PS-Poll frame?

       A. 802.11 power management

       B. 802.11 power save polling

       C. 802.11e automatic power save delivery

       D. 802.11n power save multi-poll

       *答案解析*

       A. 802.11 power management is the only power management method
       that uses the PS-Poll frame. 802.11 power save polling is not a
       power management method. 802.11e APSD uses null data frames to
       alternate between power management modes. 802.11n PSMP does not
       use PS-Poll frames. 

    6. If the only station that has buffered unicast frames at the AP
       was assigned an AID of 27, what will be the value of the Bitmap
       Offset in the TIM information element? 

       A. 1

       B. 2

       C. 3

       D. 4

       *答案解析*

       A. The Bitmap Offset defines how many 8-bit sequences (octets) may be eliminated from
       the Partial Virtual Bitmap field because of the stations not having unicast frames buffered
       at the AP. Each station is assigned an AID, and if the station does not have any unicast
       frames buffered at the AP, then the value for that station’s AID in the Partial Virtual Bitmap
       is 0. If an entire byte of AIDs at the start of the bitmap are 0s (AIDs 0–7, 8–15, 16–24, and
       so on), then a Bitmap Offset value can be set. If the station with an AID of 27 is the first
       AID with unicast frames buffered at the AP, then a Bitmap Offset value of 1 (meaning that
       AIDs 0–7 and 8–15 are all set to 0) would be used.

       If the Bitmap Offset were set to 2, then AIDs 0–7, 8–15, 16–23,
       and 24–31 would all be equal to 0. Since AID 27 is equal to 1
       in the Partial Virtual Bitmap, 2 is incorrect. 
       
    7. What is the minimum value of the Length field of the TIM
       information element? 

       A. 4

       B. 5
       
       C. 6
       
       D. 7

       *答案解析*

       A. The Length field defines how many bytes are used by
       information carrying fields in the TIM information element. The
       DTIM Count, DTIM Period, Bitmap Control, and Partial Virtual
       Bitmap are the fields of the TIM, and each field has a minimum
       length of 1 byte. Therefore, 4 is the lowest possible value for
       the Length field. 

    8. What is the element ID of the TIM information element?

       A. 4

       B. 5

       C. 6

       D. 7

       *答案解析*

       B. 5 is the element ID for the TIM information element.

    9. Which of the following is false?

       A. Stations must use the PS-Poll frame to retrieve buffered
       unicast frames from the AP when 802.11 power management is
       used.

       B. Stations use the DTIM beacon to view information about
       unicast, multicast, and broadcast frames that are buffered at
       the AP. 

       C. Stations must always be awake when DTIM beacon frames are
       sent by the AP.

       D. Stations using 802.11e U-APSD will never transmit a PS-Poll
       frame.

       *答案解析*

       C. Stations with the Receive DTIMs setting set to false will
       not wake up for DTIM beacon frames from the AP. 802.11 power
       management does involve stations retrieving unicast frames from
       the AP using PS-Poll frames. DTIM beacon frames do carry
       information about unicast, multicast, and broadcast frames
       buffered at the AP. U-APSD does not support the use of PS-Poll
       frames. 

    10. Which additional fields are added to the TIM information
        element in a DTIM beacon frame?
        
        A. DTIM Count
        
        B. DTIM Period
        
        C. Both A and B
        
        D. Neither A nor B

        *答案解析*

        D. The DTIM Count and DTIM Period fields are present in all
        TIM information elements of beacon frames. If a beacon is a
        DTIM beacon, then the DTIM Count field will be set to 0. The
        DTIM Period field plays no role in identifying whether a
        beacon is a DTIM beacon. 

    11. Which type of power management frame is used only in an IBSS?

        A. ATIM

        B. DTIM
        
        C. CF-Poll

        D. PS-Poll

        *答案解析*

        A. The ATIM is a frame used in IBSS networks to allow a
        station with frames in its buffer to notify a sleeping station
        that the frames are ready to be retrieved. DTIM is not a type
        of frame. CF-Poll and PS-Poll frames are not unique to IBSS
        networks. 

    12. Which type of frame used during power management is a control
        frame?

        A. ATIM

        B. Beacon

        C. PS-Poll

        D. Null

        *答案解析*

        C. The PS-Poll is a control frame. The ATIM and beacon frames
        are management frames. The null frame is a data frame. 

    13. When a station sends a PS-Poll frame to the AP, how many
        frames of buffered unicast data are retrieved?

        A. 0

        B. 1

        C. Enough to fill a single TXOP

        D. All unicast frames in the AP’s buffer

        *答案解析*

        B. A PS-Poll frame retrieves one unicast frame buffered at the
        AP. Null data frames retrieve all unicast frames in the AP’s
        buffer. Frames that are not PS-Poll frames and that have the
        power management flag in the 802.11 header set to 1 retrieve 0
        unicast frames from the AP’s buffer. There is no type of
        frame that retrieves only a single TXOP’s worth of unicast
        frames from the AP’s buffer. 

    14. When an AP is sending a unicast frame to a station in response
        to a PS-Poll, which flag in the 802.11 header lets the station
        know whether there are more frames in the AP’s buffer for the
        station to retrieve?

        A. From DS
        
        B. More data

        C. Order

        D. Power management

        *答案解析*

        B. The More Data flag in the 802.11 header is set to 1 by the
        AP when additional unicast frames are still in the AP’s
        buffer. The From DS and Order flags have nothing to do with
        power management. The Power Management flag is set to 1 by
        stations as a way of indicating to the AP that frames should
        be held in the AP’s buffer. 

    15. Which field in the TIM information element is used to indicate
        whether broadcast and/or multicast frames are buffered at the
        AP?

        A. DTIM Count

        B. DTIM Period

        C. Bitmap Control

        D. Partial Virtual Bitmap

        *答案解析*

        C. When broadcast and/or multicast frames are buffered at the
        AP, the first bit of the Bitmap Control field (which
        corresponds to AID 0) will be set to 1. 

        The DTIM Count, DTIM Period, and Partial Virtual Bitmap fields
        are all present in DTIM beacon frames, but none of them
        carries the indicator to stations that broadcast and/or
        multicast frames that are buffered at the AP. 

    16. Which of the following are reasons that stations might wake up
        from the doze state? (Choose two.)

        A. The station has received a frame from the AP.

        B. The station’s NAV timer expires.

        C. The station has a frame ready to be transmitted.

        D. The station expects a DTIM beacon frame to be transmitted
        by the AP.

        *答案解析*

        C, D. Stations may wake from the doze state when a frame is
        ready to be transmitted, if the station expects a DTIM beacon
        frame or if the station has an internal timer that tells it
        when to wake up. Receiving a frame from the AP would not
        affect a dozing station because a station’s radio cannot
        receive frames when dozing. The NAV timer has nothing to do
        with power management.

    17. If a station has sent a frame to the AP with the power
        management flag set to 1, which of the following states may
        the station go into? (Choose all that apply.) 

        A. Doze

        B. Idle

        C. Receive

        D. Transmit

        *答案解析*
        
        A, B, C, D. All states may be used by stations that are in
        Power Save mode. When a station goes into Power Save mode, it
        causes the AP to buffer frames, but it does not prevent the
        station from transmitting, receiving, or staying awake and in
        the idle state. 

    18. If a station has sent a frame to the AP with the power
        management flag set to 0, which of the following states may
        the station go into? (Choose all that apply.) 

        A. Doze

        B. Idle

        C. Receive

        D. Transmit

        *答案解析*

        B, C, D. The doze state may not be used by a station that is
        in active mode, because APs will not buffer frames if all
        stations are in active mode. 

    19. Name two reasons why 802.11 power management is considered
        inefficient.

        A. All buffered unicast frames sent by the AP must be followed
        by an acknowledgment frame.

        B. All buffered unicast frames sent by the AP must be preceded
        by a PS-Poll frame.

        C. Too much protocol overhead is caused by the acknowledgment
        frames that follow retrieved unicast frames from the AP’s
        buffer.

        D. Too much protocol overhead is caused by the PS-Poll frames
        that precede retrieved unicast frames from the AP’s buffer.

        *答案解析*

        B, D. 802.11 power management is inefficient because the
        transmission of a PS-Poll frame by stations in advance of
        retrieving buffered unicast frames from the AP causes the
        station to drain too much battery life and causes too much
        overhead to be added to the channel. Acknowledgment frames are
        not added to the network when 802.11 power management is
        used. 

    20. You perform a frame capture on a BSS that has a WMM Power
        Save–certified AP. You notice in the beacon frames that the
        Beacon Interval is 100 and the DTIM Period is 3. You also
        notice that when your station is idle, null data frames are
        transmitted once every second and that the power management
        flag alternates between 0 and 1 in those null data
        frames. What does this mean? (Choose two.) 

        A. The Receive DTIMs setting in your station is set to false.

        B. The Receive DTIMs setting in your station is set to true.

        C. The station supports U-APSD.

        D. The station does not support U-APSD.

        *答案解析*

        A, D. If the Beacon Interval field is 100 and the DTIM Period
        field is 3, then a DTIM beacon frame is transmitted by the AP
        every 300 kilomicroseconds (approximately every 300
        milliseconds). If the delta time between a station’s
        transmitted null data frames alternating the power management
        mode is 1 second (1,000 milliseconds), then that means the
        station is dozing while DTIM beacon frames are being
        transmitted by the AP. The only way a station may doze while
        DTIM beacon frames are being transmitted by the AP is if the
        Receive DTIMs setting on the station is set to false. 

        If the Receive DTIMs setting on the station were set to true,
        then a station would show a delta time of no more than three
        tenths of a second if the Beacon Interval is 100 and the DTIM
        Period is 3. 

        The use of null data frames rather than QoS null data frames
        indicates that the station is not using U-APSD, but rather the
        non-802.11e power management method that is similar to
        U-APSD. 

* CH09 802.11 Security
** Authentication
    Authentication是WiFi设备连接某个BSS之前所需要进行的两个步骤之一，
    并且一定要在Association之前进行。这步其实所做的事情基本类似于将有线网
    络插入网卡使得Ethernet网络物理层接通这个操作。 其目的主要就是验证
    当前设备是一个合法的802.11无线网络设备。

*** Open System Authentication
        在这种认证模式下，由Client首先发出第一帧Auth包，然后AP回复成功
        或失败。WEP加密方式是可选的，且主要是在关联成功后，加密Layer 3
        层以上的数据。 不过，目前会采用安全的安全认证方法：802.11i
        WPA/WPA2， 802.1X/EAP。

*** Shared Key Authentication
        它是一种Pre-RSNA的安全加密方法。交互过程涉及4步，如图所示：

           TKIP encryption and data integrity process:
           - TTAK = Phase 1 (TK, TA, TSC)
           - WEP seed = Phase 2 (TTAK, TK, TSC)


           Where does the 128-bit temporal key come from?

           the 128-bit temporal key is a dynamically generated key
           that comes from a 4-Way Handshake creation process. The
           128-bit temporal key can either be a pairwise transient key
           (PTK) used to encrypt unicast traffic or a group temporal
           key (GTK) used to encrypt broadcast and multicast traffic. 

           After the appropriate 128-bit temporal key (pairwise or
           group) is created, the two-phase key-mixing process begins.

**** TKIP MPDU
          The encrypted frame body consists of five key pieces:
          - IV/Key ID
          - IV/Key ID

** WPA/WPA2
      WPA是802.11i规范正式分布前的临时解决方案，它只支持TKIP/RC4动态加
      密密钥产生方法。802.11i发布后，WFA修订了WPA形成了WPA2，主要的不
      同之处是WPA2采用了CCMP/AES动态加密密钥产生机制。WPA/WPA2都支持
      802.1X/EAP、PSK认证机制。

** Robust Security Networks (RSN)
     802.11i规范正式发布后，被收录进802.11 2007标准规范中，它定义了一
     种称为RSN以及RSNA。安全关联是指一系列策略和用于保护住处的密钥。
     RSNA(robust security network association)要求两个802.11 STA之间通
     过4步握手的过程来建立一系列相互认证，关联以及创建动态加密密钥的过
     程。 两个80211 STA之间进行的关联行为称为RSNA。CCMP/AES加密方法的
     支持是制性的，而TKIP/RC4加密方法的支持是可选的。

     #+CAPTION: RSNA within an IBSS
     [[./images/2016/2016121302.png]]

     RSN网络只允许创建RSNA。 换句话说，在RSN网络中，只存在CCMP/AES或
     TKIP/RC4等两种加密方法。如果存在Pre-RSNA支持的加密方法如Dynamic
     WEP，则该网络称为TSN(transition security network)

     每个WLAN有一个逻辑名称SSID，以及一个唯一的Layer 2层标识BSSID。
     BSSID通常是AP的Mac地址。多数WLAN设备可以创建多个虚拟BSSID的能力。
     这样就可以支持创建虚拟WLAN，每个唯一的SSID名可以赋给一个特定的
     VLAN，每个VLAN与一个虚拟的BSSID关联。这样，每个VLAN拥有一个SSID和
     唯一的虚拟的Layer 2标识BSSID，这样每个WLAN可以被映射到一个唯一的
     Layer 3层的VLAN。 每个WLAN可以要求不同的安全关联类型。

** RSN Information Element
     在一个BSS内部，设备间是通过管理帧携带的RSN IE来获知对方的RSN能力
     信息的。RSN IE包含了加密能力信息，是否使用802.1X/EAP,或PSK认证机
     制等。

     RSN IE信息通常在如下4种802.11管理帧中出现：
     1. beacon management frames
     2. probe response frames
     3. association request frames
     4. reassociation request frames

     AP通过Beacon或Probe Response管理帧告知STA有关安全方面的能力信息。
     
     #+CAPTION: Access point RSN security capabilities

     802.1X可用于无线或有线环境下。 
     
     802.1X授权框架包含三个组成部分，使用Layer 2层的EAP认证协议进行交
     互，在Layer 2层对用户进行认证。

*** Supplicant
         Supplicant在Layer 2与Authentication Server进行通信。直到被AS
         认证前，它都不能在Layer 3以上进行通信。
*** Authenticator
        Authenticator维护两个虚拟端口：一个非受控端口，只允许EAP包通过。
        一个受控端口，只有在认证通过的情况下，才允许通过此端口进行通信。

*** Authentication Server
         对Supplicant进行认证。与Supplicant在Layer 2通过EAP进行通信。
         并将认证结果告知Authenticator。

        内部标识。

        外部标识只是一个伪装的标识，内部标识才是直正的标识。

        The whole purpose of tunneled authentication is to provide a
        secure channel to protect the user identity credentials. The
        user credentials are encrypted inside the TLS tunnel.

** Review Questions

    1. Laura is attempting to diagnose a WLAN by using a packet
       analyzer to capture the exchange of frames and packets between
       a wireless client and the AP. In the process of analyzing the
       packets, she sees two 802.11 authentication frames, two 802.11
       association frames, and DHCP requests and responses, and then
       she begins to see encrypted data. Which of the following could
       the client be using? (Choose all that apply.) 

       A. Open System authentication

       B. Shared Key authentication

       C. 802.1X/EAP

       D. WEP

       E. PPTP

       F. L2TP/IPsec

       *答案解析*

       A, E, F. Since there are only two 802.11 authentication frames, Open System authentication
       is being used. Shared Key authentication would generate four 802.11 authentication
       frames. If 802.1X/EAP or WEP were being used, then the client would be doing L2 encryption,
       and the DHCP frames would be encrypted and not visible. Therefore, 802.1X/EAP
       and WEP are not being used. Both PPTP and L2TP/IPsec perform layer 3 encryption that
       would allow Laura to see the DHCP exchange and any other IP traffic.

    2. This graphic shows a packet capture of a successful 802.11
       authentication. In which of the following types of client
       connections could this authentication not occur? (Choose all
       that apply.)

       [[./images/2016/2016121901.png]]

       A. 802.1X/EAP

       B. VPN

       C. WEP with Shared Key authentication

       D. WEP with Open System authentication

       E. Open System authentication with WEP

       *答案解析*

       A, D, E. The graphic shows an 802.11 Shared Key authentication that consists of four
       authentication frames: an authentication request followed by a clear-text challenge frame,
       followed by a challenge response with the clear-text data encrypted, and then followed by
       an authentication response. 802.1X/EAP works together with Open System authentication
       but cannot be deployed when WEP is used. To use Shared Key authentication, WEP must
       be enabled. A VPN can be used with Shared Key or Open System authentication. Companies
       would use a VPN for data privacy because WEP has been cracked, but they often
       would still use WEP as an added layer of security. Shared Key authentication is optional
       with WEP, although not recommended.

    3. The graphic shows a packet capture of a successful 802.11
       authentication. In which of the following types of client
       connections could this not occur? 

       [[./images/2016/2016121902.png]]

       A. 802.1X/EAP

       B. VPN

       C. WEP with Shared Key authentication

       D. WEP with Open System authentication

       E. Unencrypted

       *答案解析*

       C. The graphic shows a two-frame Open System authentication. 802.1X/EAP works
       together with Open System authentication. VPN can be configured with either Open System
       or Shared Key authentication. An unencrypted session uses Open System authentication.

    4. Given that CCMP uses a MIC for data integrity to protect the
       frame body and portions of the MAC header, what information
       needs to be constructed to protect certain fields in the MAC
       header? 

       A. Nonce

       B. Extended IV

       C. ICV

       D. AAD

       E. PN

       E. PN

       *答案解析*

       D. Additional authentication data (AAD) is constructed from portions of the MPDU
       header. This information is used for data integrity of portions of the MAC header. Receiving
       stations can then validate the integrity of these MAC header fields. The MIC protects
       the AAD information and the frame body for data integrity.

    5. How many extra bytes of overhead does TKIP/RC4 encryption add
       to the body of an 802.11 MPDU?

       A. 16 bytes

       B. 12 bytes

       C. 20 bytes

       D. 10 bytes

       E. None of the above

       *答案解析*

       C. When TKIP is implemented, because of the extra overhead from the extended IV and
       the MIC, a total of 20 bytes of overhead is added to the body of an 802.11 MPDU. CCMP/
       AES encryption will add an extra 16 bytes of overhead to the body of an 802.11 MPDU.
       WEP encryption will add an extra 8 bytes of overhead to the body of an 802.11 MPDU.

    6. The TKIP MIC is used for data integrity. Which portions of an
       802.11 MPDU does the TKIP MIC protect from being altered?
       (Choose all that apply.) 

       A. MSDU

       B. SA

       C. DA

       D. TA

       E. Frame Control field

       F. MSDU priority bit

       *答案解析*
       
       A, B, C. TKIP uses a stronger data integrity check known as the message integrity code
       (MIC) to mitigate known forgery attacks against WEP. The MIC is often referred to by its
       nickname of Michael. The MIC can be used to defeat bit-flipping attacks, fragmentation
       attacks, redirection, and impersonation attacks. The MIC is computed using the destination
       address (DA), source address (SA), MSDU Priority, and the entire unencrypted MSDU
       plaintext data. After the MIC is generated, it is appended to the end of the MSDU payload.

    7. What does 802.1X/EAP provide when implemented for WLAN
       security? (Choose all that apply.)

       A. Access to network resources

       B. Verification of access point credentials

       C. Dynamic authentication

       D. Dynamic encryption-key generation

       E. Verification of user credentials

       *答案解析*

       A, D, E. The purpose of 802.1X/EAP is authentication of user credentials and authorization
       to access network resources. Although the 802.1X framework does not require encryption,
       it highly suggests the use of encryption. A by-product of 802.1X/EAP is the generation
       and distribution of dynamic encryption keys. Although the encryption process is actually a
       byproduct of the authentication process, the goals of authentication and encryption are very
       different. Authentication provides mechanisms for validating user identity while encryption
       provides mechanisms for data privacy or confidentiality.

    8. View the frame capture of the 4-Way Handshake in the graphic
       shown here. Which EAPOL-Key message frame is displayed?

       [[./images/2016/2016121903.png]]

       A. 4-Way Handshake message 1

       B. 4-Way Handshake message 2

       C. 4-Way Handshake message 3

       D. 4-Way Handshake message 4

       *答案解析*

       C. The third EAPOL-Key frame of the 4-Way Handshake may also contain a message to
       the supplicant to install the temporal keys. The frame capture indicates that the temporal
       key is to be installed. The third EAPOL-Key frame also sends the supplicant the ANonce,
       the authenticator’s RSN information element capabilities, and a MIC. If a GTK has been
       generated, the GTK will be inside the third EAPOL-Key frame. The GTK confidentiality is
       protected because it will be encrypted with the PTK.

    9. What are some of the frames that carry the security
       capabilities found in the RSN information element? (Choose all
       that apply.) 

       A. Beacon management frame

       B. Probe request frame

       C. Probe response frame

       D. Association request frame

       E. EAPOL-Key frame

       F. Request-to-Send frame

       *答案解析*

       A, C, D, E. The RSN information element field is found in four different 802.11 management
       frames: beacon management frames, probe response frames, association request
       frames, and reassociation request frames. The RSN information element can also be found
       in the second and third EAPOL-Key frames of the 4-Way Handshake.

    10. In a robust security network (RSN), which 802.11 management
        frames are used by client stations to inform an access point
        about the RSNA security capabilities of the client
        STAs?(Choose all that apply.) 

        A. Beacon management frame

        B. Probe request frame

        C. Probe response frame

        D. Association request frame

        E. Reassociation response frame

        F. Reassociation request frame

        G. Association response frame

        *答案解析*

        D, F. The RSN information element field is found in four different 802.11 management
       frames: beacon management frames, probe response frames, association request frames,
       and reassociation request frames. Within a basic service set, an access point and client
       stations use the RSN information element within these four management frames to communicate
       with each other about their security capabilities prior to establishing association.
       Client stations use the association request frame to inform the access point of the client
       station security capabilities. When stations roam from one access point to another access
       point, they use the reassociation request frame to inform the new access point of the roaming
       client station’s security capabilities. The security capabilities include supported encryption
       cipher suites and supported authentication methods.

    11. After viewing the frame capture shown here, identify the type
        of authentication method being used.

        [[./images/2016/2016121904.png]]

        A. EAP-TTLS

        B. Open System

        C. PSK

        D. EAP-TLS

        E. PEAP

        *答案解析*

        C. The RSN information element can also be used to indicate what authentication methods
       are supported. The authentication key management (AKM) suite field in the RSN information
       element indicates whether the station supports either 802.1X authentication or PSK
       authentication. If the AKM suite value is 00-0F-AC-01, authentication is negotiated over an
       802.1X infrastructure using an EAP protocol. If the AKM suite value is 00-0F-AC-02, then
       PSK is the authentication method that is being used.

    12. Which of these roaming methods requires the use of FT Action
        frames?

        A. Over-the-air fast BSS transition

        B. Over-the-WDS fast BSS transition

        C. Over-the-DS fast BSS transition

        D. Over-the-WLS fast BSS transition

        *答案解析*

        C. The pairwise transient key (PTK) is the third-level key of the FT key hierarchy. The
        PTK is the final key used to encrypt 802.11 data frames. The PTK is created during either
        an over-the-air fast BSS transition frame exchange or over-the-DS fast BSS transition frame
        exchange. In any 802.11 robust security network (RSN), the PTK is used to encrypt the
        MSDU payload of an 802.11 unicast data frame.

    13. Before an 802.11 client STA can pass traffic through the AP,
        which two of the following must occur? (Choose two answers.)

        A. 802.1X

        B. EAP

        C. Association

        D. Authentication

        E. WEP keys must match

        *答案解析*

        C, D. For a client to connect to the WLAN and pass data, the client must authenticate and
        associate. The other three choices could occur but do not have to do so.

    14. How many extra bytes of overhead does CCMP/AES encryption add
        to the body of an 802.11 data frame?

        A. 16 bytes

        B. 12 bytes

        C. 20 bytes

        D. 10 bytes

        E. None of the above

        *答案解析*

        A. CCMP/AES encryption will add an extra 16 bytes of overhead to the body of an 802.11
        data frame. Eight bytes are added by the CCMP header and 8 bytes are added by the MIC.
        WEP encryption will add an extra 8 bytes of overhead to the body of an 802.11 data frame.
        When TKIP is implemented, because of the extra overhead from the extended IV and the
        MIC, a total of 20 bytes of overhead is added to the body of an 802.11 data frame.

    15. A data integrity check known as message integrity code (MIC)
        is used by which of the following?(Choose all that apply.) 

        A. WEP

        B. TKIP

        C. CCMP
        
        D. AES

        E. DES

        *答案解析*

        B, C. A stronger data integrity check known as a message integrity code (MIC), or by its
        common name, Michael, was introduced with TKIP to correct some of the weaknesses in
        WEP. CCMP also uses a MIC. AES and DES are encryption algorithms and are not concerned
        with message integrity.

    16. How does a RADIUS server communicate with an authenticator?
        (Choose all that apply.)

        A. UDP ports 1812 and 1813

        B. TCP ports 1645 and 1646

        C. Encrypted TLS tunnel

        D. Encrypted IPsec tunnel

        E. RADIUS IP packets
        
        F. EAPOL frames

        *答案解析*

        A, E. The RADIUS protocol uses UDP ports 1812 for RADIUS authentication and 1813
        for RADIUS accounting. These ports were officially assigned by the Internet Assigned
        Number Authority (IANA). However, prior to IANA allocation of UDP ports 1812 and
        1813, the UDP ports of 1645 and 1646 (authentication and accounting, respectively) were
        used as the default ports by many RADIUS server vendors. TCP is not used. All Layer
        2 EAP traffic sent between the RADIUS server and the authenticator is encapsulated in
        RADIUS IP packets. The encrypted TLS tunnel communications are between the supplicant
        and the authentication server. IPsec is not used.

    17. What must occur in order for dynamic TKIP/RC4 or CCMP/AES
        encryption keys to be generated? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. Shared Key authentication and 4-Way Handshake

        B. 802.1X/EAP authentication and 4-Way Handshake

        C. Open System authentication and 3-Way Handshake

        D. Open System authentication and 4-Way Handshake

        E. 802.1X/EAP authentication and 3-Way Handshake

        *答案解析*

        B, D. Open System and Shared Key authentication are legacy authentication methods that
        do not provide seeding material to generate dynamic encryption keys. However, a four-way
        Open System authentication must occur prior to the EAP exchange. A robust security network
        association requires a four-frame EAP exchange known as the 4-Way Handshake that
        is used to generate dynamic TKIP or CCMP keys.

    18. After viewing the frame capture in the graphic shown here,
        identify which type of security network is being used. 

        [[./images/2016/2016121905.png]]

        A. Robust Security Network

        B. Rotund Security Network

        C. Transition Security Network

        D. WPA Security Network

        E. WPA

        *答案解析*

        C. The frame capture shows an RSN information element field that can be found in a management
        frame. The RSN information element shows that the group cipher that is being
        used is WEP. A transition security network (TSN) supports RSN-defined security as well as
        legacy security such as WEP within the same BSS. Within a TSN, some client stations will
        use RSNA security using TKIP/RC4 or CCMP/AES for encrypting unicast traffic. However,
        some legacy stations are still using static WEP keys for unicast encryption. All of the clients
        will use WEP encryption for the broadcast and multicast traffic. Because all the stations
        share a single group encryption key for broadcast and multicast traffic, the lowest common
        denominator must be used for the group cipher.

    19. 802.11w provides protection for which of the following types
        of frames? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. Unicast

        B. Broadcast

        C. Anycast

        D. Simulcast

        E. Multicast

        *答案解析*

        A, B, E. 802.11w provides protection for unicast, broadcast, and multicast management
        frames. These 802.11w frames are referred to as robust management frames. Anycast and
        simulcast frames do not exist.

    20. 802.11w Protected Management Frames was created to prevent
        which of the following types of attacks? (Choose all that
        apply.)

        A. Denial of service

        B. Deauthentication attack

        C. Disassociation attack

        D. Impersonation attack

        E. Bit-flipping attack

        *答案解析*

        A, B, C. 802.11w was developed to provide security for management frames. This prevents
        denial-of-service attacks, such as deauthentication attacks and disassociation attacks. It
        will not prevent bit-flipping attacks. Some impersonation attacks use denial of service prior
        to performing the impersonation; however, since some do not use DoS attacks, this answer
        is not always correct.
