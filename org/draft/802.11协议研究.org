*** 802.11z
        Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS), which enables direct device
        to device communication but requires stations to be associated
        with the same AP.

** 802.11 State Machine
   It consists of the four states of client connectivity during a
   session.
   - State 1
    In State 1 the client is Unauthenticated and
    Unassociated. Clients in this state are passing Class 1 frames
    and contain the following frames:
     * Control frames
     * Management frames
     * Data frames
       + Data frames between STAs and IBSS
       + Data frames between peers using DLS
   要想离开状态1,需要执行一次成功的论证。

   - State 2
     In State 2 the client is Authenticated but Unassociated. 802.11
     Authentication是指Open or Shared Key， 而不是执行802.1X or PSK
     authentication。
     如果论证成功，则进入State 3,否则退回到State 1. 这阶段论证通过只代
     表双方同意进一步交流。
   - State 3
     In State 3 the client is Authenticated and Associated.  我们已经
     成功关联到AP，但是RSN论证还会进行（802.1X）。此时，允许如下帧通过：
     + Data frames (all)
     + Management frames
     + Control frames
       在此状态中，有三种方式离开：disassociation, deauthentication,
       and 802.1X port control unblocked. 
       If the client disassociates they will drop to State 2,
       deauthentication will drop to State 1. Having a successful
       802.1X authorization moves to State 4.
   - State 4
     在此状态，完成了4步握手，所有的数据都能够通过。

** 一些扫描行为
    1. Active scan
       - Directed probe
         The client sends a probe request with a specific destination
         SSID; only APs with a matching SSID will reply with a probe
         response
       - Broadcast probe
         The client sends a broadcast SSID (actually a null SSID) in
         the probe request; all APs receiving the probe-request will
         respond, with a probe-response for each SSID they support.

    2. Passive scan
       Passive scanning is performed by simply changing the clients
       IEEE 802.11 radio tothe channel being scanned and waiting for a
       periodic beacon from any APs on that channel. 


    During a channel scan, the client is unable to transmit or receive
    client data traffic.There are a number of approaches clients take
    to minimize this impact to client data traffic:
    1. Background scanning
       Clients may scan available channels before they need to
       roam. This allows them to build-up knowledge of the RF
       environment and available APs so they may roam faster if it
       becomes necessary. Impact to client traffic can be minimized by
       only scanning when the client is not actively transmitting
       data, or by periodically scanning only a single alternate
       channel at a time (scanning a single channel incurs minimal
       data loss)

       The term "background" is quite misleading and many people
       thought that the hardware will somehow scan without having an
       effect on the transfer rate. This is certainly not true. In
       cases where scanning causes problems a second radio is needed

    2. On-roam scanning
       In contrast with background, on-roam scanning occurs after a
       roam has been determined necessary. Each vendor/device may
       implement its own algorithms to minimize the roam latency and
       the impact to data traffic. For example, some clients might
       only scan the non-overlapping channels.
