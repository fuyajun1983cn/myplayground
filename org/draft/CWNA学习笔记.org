** Review Questions
   1. 802.11 technology is typically deployed at which fundamental
      layer of network architecture?

      A. Core

      B. Distribution

      =C. Access=

      D. Network

      - 答案解析
        C. 802.11 wireless networking is typically used to connect
        client stations to the network via an access
        point. Autonomous and lightweight access points are deployed
        at the access layer, not the core or distribution layer. The
        Physical layer is a layer of the OSI model, not a network
        architecture layer.

      D. FCC

      =E. IETF=

      - 答案解析
        E. The IETF is responsible for creation of RFC documents. The
        IEEE is responsible for the 802 standards. The Wi-Fi Alliance
        is responsible for certification tests. The Wi-Fi Alliance
        used to be known as WECA but changed its name to Wi-Fi
        Alliance in 2002. The FCC is responsible for RF regulatory
        rules in the United States. 

   10. The Wi-Fi Alliance is responsible for which of the following
       certification programs?

       A. 802.11i

       B. WEP

       C. 802.11-2012

       =D. WMM=

       E. PSK

       - 答案解析
         D. Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM) is a Wi-Fi Alliance certification
         program that enables Wi-Fi networks to prioritize traffic
         generated by different applications. 802.11-2012 is the IEEE
         standard, and WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) is defined as
         part of the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard. 802.11i was the IEEE
         amendment that defined robust security network (RSN) and is
         also part of the 802.11-2012 standard. PSK is not a
         standard; it is an encoding technique.

   11. Which wave properties can be modulated to encode data? (Choose
       all that apply.)

       =A. Amplitude=

       =B. Frequency=

         mechanisms at only the Physical layer and MAC sublayer of
         the Data-Link layer of the OSI model. 

   13. The height or power of a wave is known as what?

       A. Phase

       B. Frequency

       =C. Amplitude=

       D. Wavelength

       - 答案解析
         C. Height and power are two terms that describe the
         amplitude of a wave. Frequency is how often a wave repeats
         itself. Wavelength is the actual length of the wave,
         typically measured from peak to peak. Phase refers to the
         starting point of a wave in relation to another wave.

       =C. Anyone can use the frequency band.=

       D. There are no rules.

       - 答案解析
         B and C. The main advantages of an unlicensed frequency are
         that permission to transmit on the frequency is free and
         that anyone can use the unlicensed frequency. Although there
         are no additional financial costs, you still must abide by
         transmission regulations and other restrictions. The fact
         that anyone can use the frequency band is also a
         disadvantage because of overcrowding.

       B. Six

       =C. Seven=

       D. Nine

       - 答案解析
         C. The OSI model is sometimes referred to as the seven-layer model.
     
* 第二章 无线射频基础
** 射频(Radio Frequency, RF)信号的定义

   物理层的核心是射频传输。

   射频信号刚开始是由信号发送器产生的一种交流电信号，这种交流电信号通
   过铜导线（同轴线缆），以电磁波的形式通过天线发射出去。

** 射频的特征
   
   每个射频信号具备如下几个特征：

   - 波长

     射频信号的波长是一个周期传输的距离。

     一般人认为更高频率的电磁波信号，波长更小，信号衰减速度比低频率，波长
     较长的电磁波要快。而实际上，RF信号的频率和波长属性并不会导致信号
     衰减，而距离才是导致信号衰减的主要原因。 

     所有天线都有一个接收功率的有效区域，称为孔径(apertune), 更高频率
     的天线接收较低频率的信号所需要的RF能量要小些。

     尽量波长和频率不会造成衰减，但给人的感觉就是较小波长的高频率信号
     比较长波长的低频率信号衰减更快。所以，当无线链路其他情况一样的条
     件下，使用5G无线电波的Wi-Fi设备会比使用2.4G无线电波的设备拥有较小
     的传输距离和较小的覆盖范围。

     Site Survey: 测试设备的信号覆盖范围的一个过程。

   - 频率

     一个RF信号一秒钟出现的周期次数即为信号的频率，单位Hz。波长与频率
     成反比。

   - 振幅

     RF信号的一个非常重要的属性，可描述为信号的强度。振幅会由于信号的
     衰减而变化，但是信号的波长和频率却是保持不变的。

   - 相位

     一般是用于描述信号之间的关系。

** 射频的行为

   - 波传播(Wave propagation)

     RF信号传输的过程，即远离发送方天线的过程。

   - 吸收(Absorption)

     RF最常见的行为是吸收。如果一个信号并没有从一个物体中反射回来，而
     是通过了该物体，则认为发生了100%的信号吸收。

     不同材料的物体对信号的吸收情况不一样。砖和混凝土结构的墙面会吸收
     相当多的信号，而干燥的墙面则会相对吸收少些信号。比如2.4G信号通过
     一个砖墙后，还剩下1/16的信号强度，但是如果通过普通的墙面，则仅损
     失大概1/2的信号强度。水也是一种媒介，会吸收大部分信号。

   - 反射(Reflection)

     当一个无线电波碰到一个比它大的光滑的物体时，电磁波会反转到另一个
     方向传播，这种行为称为反射。一般金属制造的物体都会反射电磁波。

     当反射的信号与原始信号会产生传输的时间差，即deplay spread，会导致
     intersymbol干涉，从而导致数据被破坏以及Layer 2数据重传。

     反射是802.11a/b/g WLAN无线设备性能差的一个主要原因之一。因为反射
     会产生多径效应，多径效应会降低接收到的信号的强度和质量，甚至会导
     致数据破坏或信号归零。

     802.11n和802.11ac无线电波利用了MIMO天线阵列和高级的信号处理技术，
     可以利用多径效应，发掘出它的优势，并应用在数据传输上。

   - 散射(Scattering)

     百度百科：散射是指由传播介质的不均匀性引起的光线向四周射去的现象。
     如一束光通过稀释后的牛奶后为粉红色，而从侧面和上面看，却是浅蓝色
     的。

   - 折射(Refraction)

     当一个RF信号通过不同密度的媒介时，会导致电波波的方向发生改变，这
     种现象称为折射。折射一般是由于大气条件产生的。

     三种最常见的折射原因为：水蒸气，空气温度的变化以及空气压力的变化。

   - 衍射(Diffraction)

     衍射是指信号经过一个障碍物体时，传播路径发生了变化，没有碰到障碍
     物的其他电波仍然保持原来的传播路径和方向。 衍射现象会导致在障碍物
     的背面产生一个区域称为RF阴影区，这块区域要么完全收不到电波信号，
     要么只能收到比较弱的电波信号。

   - 衰减(Loss (attenuation))

     指信号强度或振幅降低了。在无线通信过程的有线部分，即RF线缆，AC电
     流信号会损失强度，因为同轴线缆和其他连接器件有电子阻抗。

   - 自由空间路径损耗(Free space path loss)

     即便排除上述的一些因素，根据物理定律，一个无线电波在向四周传播过
     程中，随着距离越来越远，信号强度也会越来越弱，直到接收器无法感知
     到该信号的存在。

   - 多径(Multipath)

     由于上述存在的反射，散射，折射，衍射等现象，会导致相同的信号存在
     多条传输路径。

   - 增益(Gain (amplification))

     加大信号的振幅或信号强度。有两种类型的增益：主动增益和被动增益。

     收发器和RF放大器是主动增益设备，而天线是被动增益设备。

** Review Questions
    1. What are some results of multipath interference? (Choose all
       that apply.)

       A. Scattering delay

       B. =Upfade=

       C. =Excessive retransmissions=

       D. Absorption

       E. 答案解析
          B and C. Multipath may result in attenuation, amplification,
          signal loss, or data corruption. If two signals arrive
          together in phase, the result is an increase in signal
          strength called upfade. The delay spread may also be too
          significant and cause data bits to be corrupted, resulting in
          excessive layer 2 retransmissions. 

    2. What term best defines the linear distance traveled in one
       positive-to-negative-to-positive oscillation of an
       electromagnetic signal? 
       
       A. Crest

       B. Frequency

       C. Trough

       =D. Wavelength=

       - 答案解析
         A. The wavelength is the linear distance between the
         repeating crests (peaks) or repeating troughs (valleys) of a
         single cycle of a wave pattern.

    3. Which of the following statements are true about amplification?
       (Choose all that apply.)

       A. All antennas require an outside power source.

       B. =RF amplifiers require an outside power source.=

       C. =Antennas are passive gain amplifiers that focus the energy of a signal.=

       D. RF amplifiers passively increase signal strength by
       focusing the AC current of the signal.

       - 答案解析
         B and C. RF amplifiers introduce active gain with the help of
         an outside power source. Passive gain is typically created by
         antennas that focus the energy of a signal without the use of
         an outside power source. 
       
    4. A standard measurement of frequency is called what?
       
       A. =Hertz=

       B. Milliwatt

       C. Nanosecond

       D. Decibel

       E. K-factor

       -. 答案解析
          A. The standard measurement of the number of times a signal
          cycles per second is hertz (Hz). One Hz is equal to one cycle
          in 1 second. 

    5. When an RF signal bends around(绕过) an object, this propagation
       behavior is known as what?

       A. Stratification

       B. Refraction(折射）

       C. Scattering

       D. =Diffraction=（衍射）

       E. Attenuation

       - 答案解析
          A. Often confused with refraction, the diffraction
          propagation is the bending of the wave front around an
          obstacle. Diffraction is caused by some sort of partial
          blockage of the RF signal, such as a small hill or a building
          that sits between a transmitting radio and a receiver.

    6. When the multiple RF signals arrive at a receiver at the same
       time and are ___  with the primary wave, the result can be ___
       of the primary signal.

       A. out of phase, scattering

       B. =in phase, intersymbol interference=

       C. in phase, attenuation

       D. 180 degrees out of phase, amplification

       E. in phase, cancellation

       F. =180 degrees out of phase, cancellation=

       - 答案解析
         F. Nulling, or cancellation, can occur when multiple RF
         signals arrive at the receiver at the same time and are 180
         degrees out of phase with the primary wave. 

    7. Which of the following statements are true? (Choose all that
       apply.)

       A. When upfade occurs, the final received signal will be stronger than the original transmitted signal.

       B. =When downfade occurs, the final received signal will never be tronger than the origioriginal transmitted signal.=

       C. =When upfade occurs, the final received signal will never be stronger than the original transmitted signal.=

       D. When downfade occurs, the final received signal will be
          stronger than the original transmitted signal.

       - 答案解析
         B and C. When the multiple RF signals arrive at the receiver
         at the same time and are in phase or partially out of phase
         with the primary wave, the result is an increase in signal
         strength (amplitude). However, the final received signal,
         whether affected by upfade or downfade, will never be
         stronger than the original transmitted signal because of free
         space path loss. 

    8. What is the frequency of an RF signal that cycles 2.4 million
       times per second?

       A. 2.4 hertz

       B. =2.4 MHz=

       C. 2.4 GHz

       D. 2.4 kilohertz

       E. 2.4 KHz

       - 答案解析
         B. 802.11 wireless LANs operate in the 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz
         frequency range. However，2.4 GHz is equal to 2.4 billion
         cycles per second. The frequency of 2.4 million cycles per
         second is 2.4 MHz. 

    9. What is the best example of a time domain tool that could be
       used by an RF engineer?

       A. =Oscilloscope=

       B. Spectroscope

       C. Spectrum analyzer

       D. Refractivity gastroscope

       - 答案解析
         A. An oscilloscope is a time domain tool that can be used to
         measure how a signal’s amplitude changes over time. A
         frequency domain tool called a spectrum analyzer is a more
         commonplace tool most often used during site surveys. 

    10. What are some objects or materials that are common causes of
        reflection? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. =Metal=

        B. Trees

        C. =Asphalt road=

        D. =Lake=

        E. Carpet floors(地毯)

        - 答案解析
          A, C and D. This is a tough question to answer because many
          of the same mediums can cause several different propagation
          behaviors. Metal will always bring about reflection. Water
          is a major source of absorption; however, large bodies of
          water can also cause reflection. Flat surfaces such as
          asphalt roads, ceilings, and walls will also result in
          reflection behavior. 

    11. Which of these propagation behaviors can result in multipath?
        (Choose all that apply.)

        A. =Refraction=

        B. =Diffraction=

        C. =Reflection=

        D. =Scattering=

        E. None of the above

        - 答案解析
          A, B, C and D. Multipath is a propagation phenomenon that
          results in two or more paths of a signal arriving at a
          receiving antenna at the same time or within nanoseconds of
          each other. Because of the natural broadening of the waves,
          the propagation behaviors of reflection, scattering,
          diffraction, and refraction can all result in multiple paths
          of the same signal. The propagation behavior of reflection
          is usually considered to be the main cause of high-multipath
          environments. 

    12. Which behavior can be described as an RF signal encountering a
        chain link fence, causing the signal to bounce into multiple
        directions?

        A. Diffraction

        B. =Scatter=

        C. Reflection

        D. Refraction

        E. Multiplexing

        - 答案解析
          B. Scattering, or scatter, is defined as an RF signal
          reflecting in multiple directions when encountering an
          uneven surface. 

    13. Which 802.11 radio technologies are most impacted by the
        destructive effects of multipath? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. =802.11a=

        B. =802.11b=

        C. =802.11g=

        D. 802.11n

        E. 802.11i

        - 答案解析
          A, B and C. High multipath environments can have a
          destructive impact on legacy 802.11a/b/g radio
          transmissions. Multipath has a constructive effect with
          802.11n and 802.11ac transmissions that utilize MIMO antenna
          diversity and maximum ratio combining (MRC) signal
          processing techniques. Multipath does not affect the
          security mechanisms defined by 802.11i. 

    14. Which of the following can cause refraction of an RF signal
        traveling through it? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. =Shift in air temperature=

        B. =Change in air pressure=

        C. =Humidity=

        D. =Smog=

        E. Wind

        F. Lightning

        - 答案解析
          A, B, C and D. Air stratification（大气分层） is a leading cause of
          refraction(折射) of an RF signal. Changes in air temperature,
          changes in air pressure, and water vapor are all causes of
          refraction. Smog can cause a density change in the air
          pressure as well as increased moisture(湿气).

    15. Which of the following statements are true about free space
        path loss? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. =RF signals will attenuate as they travel, despite the lack  of attenuation caused by obstructions.=

        B. Path loss occurs at a constant linear rate.

        C. Attenuation is caused by obstructions.

        D. =Path loss occurs at a logarithmic rate.=

        - 答案解析
          A and D. Because of the natural broadening of the wave
          front, electromagnetic signals lose amplitude as they travel
          away from the transmitter. The rate of free space path loss
          is logarithmic and not linear. Attenuation of RF signals as
          they pass through different mediums does occur but is not a
          function of FSPL. 

    16. What term is used to describe the time differential between a
        primary signal and a reflected signal arriving at a receiver?

        A. Path delay

        B. Spread spectrum

        C. Multipath

        D. =Delay spread=

        - 答案解析
          D. The time difference due to a reflected signal taking a
          longer path is known as the delay spread. The delay spread
          can cause intersymbol interference, which results in data
          corruption and layer 2 retransmissions. 

    17. What is an example of a frequency domain tool that could be
        used by an RF engineer?

        A. Oscilloscope

        B. Spectroscope

        C. =Spectrum analyzer=

        D. Refractivity gastroscope

        - 答案解析
          C. A spectrum analyzer is a frequency domain tool that can
          be used to measure amplitude in a finite frequency
          spectrum. An oscilloscope is a time domain tool. 

    18. Using knowledge of RF characteristics and behaviors, which two
        options should a WLAN engineer be most concerned about during
        an indoor site survey? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. =Brick walls=

        B. Indoor temperature

        C. =Wood-lath plaster walls=

        D. Drywall

        - 答案解析
          A and C. Brick walls are very dense and will significantly
          attenuate a 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz signal. Older structures that
          are constructed with wood-lath plaster walls often have wire
          mesh in the walls, which was used to help hold the plaster
          to the walls. Wire mesh is notorious for disrupting and
          preventing RF signals from passing through walls. Wire mesh
          is also used on stucco exteriors. Drywall will attenuate a
          signal but not to the extent of water, cinder blocks, or
          other dense mediums. Air temperature has no significance
          during an indoor site survey. 

    19. Which three properties are interrelated?

        A. =Frequency, wavelength, and the speed of light=

        B. Frequency, amplitude, and the speed of light

        C. Frequency, phase, and amplitude

        D. Amplitude, phase, and the speed of sound

        - 答案解析
          A. There is an inverse relationship between frequency and
          wavelength. A simplified explanation is that the higher the
          frequency of an RF signal, the shorter the wavelength will
          be of that signal. The longer the wavelength of an RF
          signal, the lower the frequency of that signal.

    20. Which RF behavior best describes a signal striking a medium
        and bending in a different direction?

        A. =Refraction(折射)=

        B. Scattering(散射)

        C. Diffusion

        D. Diffraction(衍射)

        E. Microwave reflection

        - 答案解析
          A. Refraction is the bending of an RF signal when it encounters a medium.

* 第三章 无线射频组件、测量与数学原理 
  
** RF通信的组件

   data send path:
   Transmitter --> Antenna Cable --> Intentional radiator(IR) --> EIRP

   #+CAPTION: RF components
   [[./images/2015/2015120202.png]]
      
*** Transmitter(发射机)

    The transmitter is the initial component in the creation of the
    wireless medium. The computer hands the data off to the
    transmitter, and it is the transmitter’s job to begin the RF
    communication.

    The transmitter takes the data provided and modifies the AC
    signal by using a modulation technique to encode the data into the
    signal.

    被调制后的AC信号现在已经变成一个载波信号，包含（承载）了要传输的数
    据。载波信号接着被直接传输到天线或通过线缆传输到天线。

    总结来看，Transmitter的主要作用是：
    1. 产生某个特定频率的信号。
    2. 决定原始信号的振幅，或者说是Transmitter的功率级别，信号波的振幅
       越大，Transmitter所需要的功率就越大。当然，这个功率要受到管理当
       局的管制。

*** Antenna(天线)

    天线提供了两个功能：
    1. When connected to the transmitter, it collects the AC signal
       that it receives from the transmitter and directs, or radiates,
       the RF waves away from the antenna in a pattern specific to
       the antenna type.

    2. When connected to the receiver, the antenna takes the RF waves
       that it receives through the air and directs the AC signal to
       the receiver.

       接收方将收到的AC Signal转换成比特和字节。

    isotropic radiator: 全方向等同辐射器，即在各个方向发射信号的强度是
    等同的。太阳是一个很好的例子。但是，生产出完成符合isotropic
    radiator要求的天线是有困难的，所以天线本身的结构也会影响各个方向上
    的信号传输。一般来说，有两种方法来增加天线的输出功率：
    1. 在Transmitter端使用更强的功率去产生信号。
    2. 使天线将信号聚集于某个方向会范围输出。

*** Receiver(接收器)

    The receiver is the final component in the wireless medium.The
    receiver takes the carrier signal that is received from the
    antenna and translates the modulated signals into 1s and 0s.

*** Intentional Radiator

    定义： a device that intentionally generates and emits radio
    frequency energy by radiation or induction.

    根据定义描述，这是一种专门设计用来产生RF的装置，它包含了：
    1. transmitter
    2. all cables and connector
    3. any other equipment(grounding, lighting arrestors, amplifiers,
       attenuators and so forth)

    IR的功率量测点是在提供给天线输入的连接点处。功率大小一般用mW或
    dBm(decibels relative to 1 milliwatt，伏特分贝)来表示。

*** Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power

    Equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) is the highest RF
    signal strength that is transmitted from a particular antenna.

    一般天线具备定向或聚集从IF传过来的RF信号能量的功能，EIRRP是从天线
    输出的一个功率，它可以放大输入进来的RF信号，所以EIRP的输出功率也是
    受到管制的一个指标。

*** Units of Power and Comparison

**** Units of power (absolute)
     1. watt (W)
     2. milliwatt (mW)
     3. decibels relative to 1 milliwatt (dBm)
        当功率为1 mW时，dBm值为0。
        dBm = 10 X log10(PmW)
        所以，100mW功率相当于+20 dBm。
        大部分802.11无线电波的信号功率为1mW到100mW，由于信号传播过程中
        的损耗，收到的信号功率一般低于1mW，-40dBm已经是收到的比较强的
        信号了。


**** Units of comparison (relative)
     1. decibel (dB)  描述功率的改变
     2. decibels relative to an isotropic radiator (dBi)  一般用来衡量
        天线增益, 即天线的信号相对输出强度。
     3. decibels relative to a half-wave dipole antenna(偶极天线) (dBd)
        a dBd value is the increase in gain of an antenna when it is
        compared to the signal of a dipole antenna.

        A standard dipole antenna has a dBi value of 2.14. If an
        antenna has a value of 3 dBd, this means that it is 3 dB
        greater than a dipole antenna.

        3 dBd = 2.14 dBi + 3 = 5.14 dBi

     Remember the 6 dB rule: +6 dB doubles the distance of the usable
     signal;–6 dB halves the distance of the usable signal.
     
** RF Mathematics

*** Rule of 10s and 3s
    - For every 3 dB of gain (relative), double the absolute power
      (mW).
      3 dB gain = mW * 2
    - For every 3 dB of loss (relative), halve the absolute power
      (mW).
      3 dB loss = mW / 2
    - For every 10 dB of gain (relative), multiply the absolute power
      (mW) by a factor of 10.
      10 dB gain = mW * 10
    - For every 10 dB of loss (relative), divide the absolute power
      (mW) by a factor of 10.
      10 dB loss = mW / 10

** Noise Floor
   背景干扰信号， 来源很多，比如：附近802.11设备传输的信号，未调制过的
   来自其他类型设备的干扰波等。背景干扰信号的振幅随着环境的不同，也不
   一样。在2.4 G ISM信道，背景干扰信号强度可能为-100dBm，然而，在RF环
   境下，背景干扰信号强度可能为-90dBm。一般情况下，5G信道干扰信号强度
   要小些，因为5G 频段相对没有2.4G拥挤。

** 信噪比(SNR)
   SNR是衡量信号质量的一个指标。SNR是接收到的信号强度与背景干扰信号强
   度之间的差值，不是比率。例如，无线设备接收到的信号强度为-85dBm，而
   背景干扰信号的强度为-100dBm，则SNR值为15dB。

   SNR值大于或等于25 dB时，则认为信号质量很好，而当SNR低于10 dB时，则
   认为信号质量很差。 

** 接收到的信号强度指示(RSSI)

   Receive sensitivity: the power level of an RF signal required to be
   successfully received by the receiver radio.

   在wlan设置中，Receive Sensitivity通常被定义为网络速度的一个功能。
   Wi-Fi厂商一般指定各种速率下Receive Sensitity阀值。对于一个接收器来
   说，要支持更高速度，就需要更多的功率。不同的速率采用不同的信号调制
   技术和编码方法。更高速率下的编码方法更容易出现数据被破坏。

   The 802.11-2012 standard defines the received signal strength
   indicator (RSSI) as a relative metric used by 802.11 radios to
   measure signal strength (amplitude). The 802.11 RSSI measurement
   parameter can have a value from 0 to 255. The RSSI value is
   designed to be used by the WLAN hardware manufacturer as a relative
   measurement of the RF signal strength that is received by an 802.11
   radio. RSSI metrics are typically mapped to receive sensitivity
   thresholds expressed in absolute dBm values.

   Received signal strength indicator (RSSI) metrics (vendor example)
   | RSSI | Receive sensitivity threshold      | Signal strength (%) | Signal-to-noise ratio | Signal quality (%) |
   |------+------------------------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+--------------------|
   |<l>  | <l5> |<l>  |<l> |<l>|
   |   30 | –30                            dBm |                100% | 70  dB                |               100% |
   |   25 | –41                            dBm |                 90% | 60  dB                |               100% |
   |   20 | –52                            dBm |                 80% | 43  dB                |                90% |
   |   21 | –52                            dBm |                 80% | 40  dB                |                80% |
   |   15 | –63                            dBm |                 60% | 33  dB                |                50% |
   |   10 | –75                            dBm |                 40% | 25  dB                |                35% |
   |    5 | –89                            dBm |                 10% | 10  dB                |                 5% |
   |    0 | –110                           dBm |                  0% | 0  dB                 |                 0% |

** Link budget

   When radio communications are deployed, a link budget is the sum of
   all the planned and expected gains and losses from the transmitting
   radio, through the RF medium, to the receiver radio.

   The purpose of link budget calculations is to guarantee that the
   final received signal amplitude is above the receiver sensitivity
   threshold of the receiver radio.

** Fade margin/system operating margin

   Fade margin is a level of desired signal above what is required. 
   如果一个接收器的Receive Sensitity是-80 dBm，即只要接收到的信号强度
   大于-80 dBm，则数据传输就能成功。但问题是，由于信号传输过程中，会受
   到一些外部干扰导致接收到的信号强度出现波动，为了应对这种波动的特点，
   通常会规划Receive Sensitity值以上的10 dB到25 dB大小的缓冲区值区间，
   这个区间值就是Fade Margin。对于Fade Margin为10 dB的情况，这时设定的
   Receive Sensitity的阀值为-70 dBm。

       E. =Isotropic radiator=

          *答案解析*

          E. An isotropic radiator is also known as a point source.

    3. When calculating the link budget and system operating margin of
       a point-to-point outdoor WLAN bridge link, what factors should
       be taken into account? (Choose all that apply.)

       A. =Distance=

       B. =Receive sensitivity=

       C. =Transmit amplitude=

       D. Antenna height

       E. =Cable loss=

       F. =Frequency=

          *答案解析*

          A, B, C, E and F. When radio communications are deployed, a
       link budget is the sum of all gains and losses from the
       transmitting radio, through the RF medium, to the receiver
       radio. Link budget calculations include original transmit gain
       and passive antenna gain. All losses must be accounted for,
       including free space path loss. Frequency and distance are
       needed to calculate free space path loss. The height of an
       antenna has no significance when calculating a link budget;
       however, the height could affect the Fresnel and blockage to
       it.

    4. The sum of all the components from the transmitter to the
       antenna, not including the antenna, is known as what? (Choose
       two.)

       A. =IR=

       B. Isotropic radiator

       C. EIRP

       D. =Intentional radiator=

          *答案解析*

          A and D. IR is the abbreviation for intentional
       radiator. The components making up the IR include the
       transmitter, all cables and connectors, and any other equipment
       (grounding, lightning arrestors, amplifiers, attenuators, and
       so forth) between the transmitter and the antenna. The power of
       the IR is measured at the connecter that provides the input to
       the antenna. 

    5. The highest RF signal strength that is transmitted from an
       antenna is known as what?

       A. =Equivalent isotropically radiated power=

       B. Transmit sensitivity

       C. Total emitted power

       D. Antenna radiated power

          *答案解析*

          A. Equivalent isotropically radiated power, also known as
             EIRP, is a measure of the strongest signal that is
             radiated from an antenna.

    6. Select the absolute units of power. (Choose all that apply.)

       A. =Watt=

       B. =Milliwatt=

       C. Decibel

       D. =dBm=

       E. Bel

          *答案解析*

          A, B and D. Watts, milliwatts, and dBms are all absolute
       power measurements. One watt is equal to 1 ampere (amp) of
       current flowing at 1 volt. A milliwatt is 1/1,000 of 1
       watt. dBm is decibels relative to 1 milliwatt. 

    7. Select the units of comparison (relative). (Choose all that
       apply.)

       A. dBm

       B. =dBi=

       C. =Decibel=

       D. =dBd=

       E. =Bel=

          *答案解析*

          B, C, D and E. The unit of measurement known as a bel is a
       relative expression and a measurement of change in power. A
       decibel (dB) is equal to one-tenth of a bel. Antenna gain
       measurements of dBi and dBd are relative measurements. dBi is
       defined as decibels referenced to an isotropic radiator. dBd is
       defined as decibels referenced to a dipole.

    8. 2 dBd is equal to how many dBi?

       A. 5 dBi

       B. 4.41 dBi

       C. =4.14 dBi=

       D. The value cannot be calculated.

          *答案解析*

          C. To convert any dBd value to dBi, simply add 2.14 to the
             dBd value.

    9. 23 dBm is equal to how many mW?

       A. =200 mW=

       B. 14 mW

       C. 20 mW

       D. 23 mW

       E. 400 mW

          *答案解析*

          A. To convert to mW, first calculate how many 10s and 3s are
             needed to add up to 23, which is 0 + 10 + 10 + 3. To
             calculate the mW, you must multiply 1 × 10 × 10 × 2. 

    10. A wireless bridge is configured to transmit at 100 mW. The
        antenna cable and connectors produce a 3 dB loss and are
        connected to a 16 dBi antenna. What is the EIRP?

        A. 20 mW

        B. 30 dBm

        C. =2,000 mW=

        D. 36 dBm

        E. 8 W

    11. A WLAN transmitter that emits a 400 mW signal is connected to
        a cable with a 9 dB loss. If the cable is connected to an
        antenna with 19 dBi of gain, what is the EIRP?

        A. =4 W=

        B. 3,000 mW

        C. 3,500 mW

        D. 2 W

    12. WLAN vendors use RSSI thresholds to trigger which radio card
        behaviors? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. Receive sensitivity

        B. =Roaming=

        C. Retransmissions

        D. =Dynamic rate switching=

           *答案解析*

           B and D. RSSI thresholds are a key factor for clients when
        they initiate the roaming handoff. RSSI thresholds are also
        used by vendors to implement dynamic rate switching, which is
        a process used by 802.11 radios to shift between data rates. 

    13. Received signal strength indicator (RSSI) metrics are used by
        802.11 radios to define which RF characteristics?

        A. =Signal strength=

        B. Phase

        C. Frequency

        D. Modulation

           *答案解析*

           A. The received signal strength indicator (RSSI) is a
              metric used by 802.11 radio cards to measure signal
              strength (amplitude). Some vendors use a proprietary
              scale to also correlate to signal quality. Most vendors
              erroneously define signal quality as the signal-to-noise
              ratio (SNR). The signal-to-noise ratio is the difference
              in decibels between the received signal and the
              background noise (noise floor). 

    14. dBi is a measure of what?

        A. The output of the transmitter

        B. =The signal increase caused by the antenna=

        C. The signal increase of the intentional transmitter

        D. The comparison between an isotropic radiator and the
        transceiver

        E. The strength of the intentional radiator

           *答案解析*

           B. dBi is defined as “decibel gain referenced to an
              isotropic radiator” or “change in power relative to an
              antenna.” dBi is the most common measurement of antenna
              gain. 

    15. Which of the following are valid calculations when using the
        rule of 10s and 3s? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. =For every 3 dB of gain (relative), double the absolute
        power (mW).=

        B. For every 10 dB of loss (relative), divide the absolute
        power (mW) by a factor of 2.

        C. For every 10 dB of loss (absolute), divide the relative
        power (mW) by a factor of 3.

        D. For every 10 mW of loss (relative), multiply the absolute
        power (dB) by a factor of 10.

        E. For every 10 dB of loss (relative), halve the absolute
        power (mW).

        F. =For every 10 dB of loss (relative), divide the absolute  power (mW) by a factor of 10.=

        *答案解析*

        A and F. The four rules of the 10s and 3s are as follows: For
        every 3 dB of gain (relative), double the absolute power
        (mW). For every 3 dB of loss (relative), halve the absolute
        power (mW). For every 10 dB of gain (relative), multiply the
        absolute power (mW) by a factor of 10. For every 10 dB of loss
        (relative), divide the absolute power (mW) by a factor of 10.
        
    16. A WLAN transmitter that emits a 100 mW signal is connected to
        a cable with a 3 dB loss.If the cable is connected to an
        antenna with 7 dBi of gain, what is the EIRP at the antenna
        element?

        A. 200 mW

        B. =250 mW=

        C. 300 mW

        D. 400 mW

    17. In a normal wireless bridged network, the greatest loss of
        signal is caused by what component?

        A. Receive sensitivity

        B. Antenna cable loss

        C. Lightning arrestor

        D. =Free space path loss=

           *答案解析*

           D. A distance of as little as 100 meters will cause FSPL of
              80 dB, far greater than any other component. RF
              components such as connectors, lightning arrestors, and
              cabling all introduce insertion loss. However, FSPL will
              always be the reason for the greatest amount of loss. 

    18. To double the distance of a signal, the EIRP must be increased
        by how many dBs?

        A. 3 dB

        B. =6 dB=

        C. 10 dB

        D. 20 dB

           *答案解析*

           B. The 6 dB rule states that increasing the amplitude by 6
              decibels will double the usable distance of an RF
              signal. The 6 dB rule is very useful for understanding
              antenna gain because every 6 dBi of extra antenna gain
              will double the usable distance of an RF signal.

    19. During a site survey of a point-to-point link between
        buildings at a manufacturing plant, the WLAN engineer
        determines that the noise floor is extremely high because of
        all the machinery that is operating in the buildings. The
        engineer is worried about a low SNR and poor performance due
        to the high noise floor. What is a suggested best practice to
        deal with this scenario?

        A. Increase the access points’ transmission amplitude.

        B. Mount the access points higher.

        C. Double the distance of the AP signal with 6 dBi of antenna
        gain.

        D. =Plan for coverage cells with a 5 dB fade margin.=

        E. Increase the transmission amplitude of the client radios.

           *答案解析*

           D. In a high-multipath or noisy environment, a common best
              practice is to add a 5 dB fade margin when designing for
              coverage based on a vendor’s recommended received
              signal strength or the noise floor, whichever is
              louder. 

    20. Which value should not be used to compare wireless network
        cards manufactured by different WLAN vendors?

        A. Receive sensitivity

        B. Transmit power range

        C. Antenna dBi

        D. =RSSI=

           *答案解析*

           D. WLAN vendors execute RSSI metrics in a proprietary
              manner. The actual range of the RSSI value is from 0 to
              a maximum value (less than or equal to 255) that each
              vendor can choose on its own (known as
              RSSI_Max). Therefore, RSSI metrics should not be used to
              compare different WLAN vendor radios because there is no
              standard for the range of values or a consistent scale.

      2. data integrity（防止被篡改）
      3. authentication（身份验证）

      802.11标准一开始定义了两种认证方法：
      1. Open System (任何人都可以通过验证)
      2. Shared Key（存在安全隐患）

      802.11i又称为RSN，提供了更强的数据加密机制和身份验证机制。主要的
      改善体现在：
      1. Data Privacy

         使用更强的加密方法CCMP，它采用的是AES算法。
         同时也定义了一个可选的加密方法TKIP，使用RC4算法，主要是为了兼
         容旧的WEP加密方式的设备。

      2. Data Integrity

         为了保证接收到的数据没有被篡改，WEP使用的方法叫做
         Initialization Check Value (ICV). TKIP使用的方法叫做Message
         Integrity Check (MIC). CCMP使用了强化版的MIC。另外，在所有的
         802.11帧最后，都包含32-bit的CRC即FCS信息，用来保护帧负载的完
         整性。

      3. Authentication

         802.11i定义了两种认证方法：
         - 802.1X with EAP methods

         - PSK(Preshared Keys)

      4. RSN

         定义了一整套方法，包含：认证建立，安全关联协商，为STA和AP动态
         产生加密密钥等。

       Channel Access (EDCA) is an extension to DCF. Hybrid
       Coordination Function Controlled Channel Access (HCCA) is an
       extension to PCF. In the real world, only EDCA is implemented.

   18. The 802.11h amendment (now part of the 802.11-2012 standard)
       introduced what two major changes for 5 GHz radios?

     =A. U-NII-2 Extended=

     B. IAPP

     =C. Radar detection=

     D. Transmit Frequency Avoidance

     E. Frequency hopping spread spectrum

       *答案解析*
       
       A and C. The 802.11h amendment effectively introduced two major
       enhancements: more frequency space in the U-NII-2 extended band
       and radar avoidance and detection technologies. All aspects of
       the 802.11h ratified amendment can now be found in Clause 10.8
       and Clause 10.9 of the 802.11-2012 standard. 

   19. The 802.11b amendment defined which PHY?

     =A. HR-DSSS=

     B. FHSS

     C. OFDM

     D. PBCC

     E. EIRP

       *答案解析*

       A. The 802.11b amendment defined systems that can transmit at
       data rates of 5.5 Mbps and 11 Mbps using High-Rate DSSS
       (HR-DSSS). 802.11b devices are also compatible with 802.11 DSSS
       devices and can transmit at data rates of 1 and 2 Mbps. 

   20. Which layers of the OSI model are referenced in the 802.11
       standard? (Choose all that   apply.)

     A. Application

     =B. Data-Link=

     C. Presentation

     =D. Physical=

     E. Transport

     F. Network

       *答案解析*

       B and D. The IEEE specifically defines 802.11 technologies at
       the Physical layer and the MAC sublayer of the Data-Link
       layer. By design, anything that occurs at the upper layers of
       the OSI model is insignificant to 802.11 communications.

** Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure Bands

     The IEEE 802.11a amendment designated WLAN transmissions within
     the frequency space of the three 5 GHz bands, each with four
     channels. These frequency ranges are known as the Unlicensed
     National Information Infrastructure (U-NII) bands.

     802.11a定义了三组频率：U-NII-1， U-NII-2，U-NII-3， 802.11h在此基
     础上又增加了12个可用信道，称为U-NII-2-Extended。目前在5G U-NII频

     - 802.11a (OFDM radios)
     - 802.11n (HT radios)
     - 802.11ac (VHT radios)

*** Future U-NII Bands

      #+CAPTION: The new 5 GHz U-NII bands
      | Old Name         | New Name | Frequency        | Channels    |
      |------------------+----------+------------------+-------------|

** Narrowband and Spread Spectrum

     有两种主要的RF传输技术：narrowband, spread spectrum。
     narrowband需要更高的功率发射信号，且易受干扰。

** Multipath Interference

     =delay spread:= the delay between the main signal and the reflected signal

     =intersymbol interference (ISI):= If the delay spread is too
     great, data from the reflected signal may interfere with the
     same data stream from the main signal

     Prior to 802.11n and 802.11ac MIMO technology, multipath had
     always been a concern.会影响性能和吞吐量。

** Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum

     used by 802.11 legacy device, 提供了1， 2Mbps的传输速率。
     the way FHSS works is that it transmits data by using a small
     frequency carrier space, then hops to another small frequency
     carrier space and transmits data, then to another frequency, and
     so on. FHSS适合用于narrowband传输中, 功耗高。

*** Hopping Sequence

      FHSS radios use a predefined hopping sequence (also called a
      hopping pattern or hopping set) comprising a series of small
      carrier frequencies, or hops.

     The 802.11 standard defines hopping sequences that can be
     configured on an FHSS access point, and the hopping sequence 
     information is delivered to client stations via the beacon
     management frame.

*** Dwell Time

      Dwell time is a defined amount of time that the FHSS system
      transmits on a specific frequency before it switches to the next
      frequency in the hop set.

*** Hop Time

      a measurement of the amount of time it takes for the transmitter
      to change from one frequency to another.

*** Modulation

      FHSS使用GFSK(Gaussian frequency shift keying)来编码数据。

** Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum

       DSSS支持2.4G下1，2Mbps速率。801.11b提出了HR-DSSS技术，支持5.5
       Mbps和11Mbps的速率。802.11b设备 兼容802.11 DSSS设备。

       DSSS is set to one channel. The data that is being transmitted is
       spread across the range of frequencies that make up the
       channel. The process of spreading the data across the channel is
       known as /data encoding/.

*** DSSS Data Encoding

       由于802.11无线传输容易受到干扰，从而导致数据被破坏，为了降低数
       据传输过程中由于RF干扰导致接收到的数据被破坏而无法恢复，每个有
       效数据比特位会被编码并作为多个比特位进行传输。

       The task of adding additional, redundant information to the
       data is known as /processing gain/.

       The system converts the 1 bit of data into a series of bits
       that are referred to as /chips/.

       例如，如下编码方式：
       Binary data 1 = 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
       Binary data 0 = 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1

       This process of converting a single data bit into a sequence is
       often called /spreading/ or /chipping/.

*** Modulation

      After the data has been encoded using a chipping method, the
      transmitter needs to modulate the signal to create a carrier
      signal containing the chips.

      #+CAPTION: DSSS and HR-DSSS encoding and modulation overview
      |         | Data rate (Mbps) | Encoding      | Chip length | Bits encoded | Modulation |
      |---------+------------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+------------|
      | DSSS    |                1 | Barker coding |          11 |            1 | DBPSK      |
      | DSSS    |                2 | Barker coding |          11 |            1 | DQPSK      |
      | HR-DSSS |              5.5 | CCK coding    |           8 |            4 | DQPSK      |
      | HR-DSSS |               11 | CCK coding    |           8 |            8 | DQPSK           |

        
*** Packet Binary Convolutional Code

       Packet Binary Convolutional Code (PBCC) is a modulation
       technique that supports data rates of 5.5, 11, 22, and 33 Mbps

*** Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing

      OFDM is not a spread spectrum technology, even though it has
      similar properties to spread spectrum, such as low transmit
      power and using more bandwidth than is required to transmit
      data. Because of these similarities, OFDM is often referred to
      as a spread spectrum technology even though technically that
      reference is incorrect. OFDM actually transmits across 52
      separate, closely and precisely spaced frequencies, often
      referred to as /subcarriers/

** Throughput vs. Bandwidth

     Wireless communication is typically performed within a
     constrained set of frequencies known as a frequency band. This
     frequency band is the /bandwidth/.

     Data encoding and modulation determine data rates, which are
     sometimes also referred to as /data bandwidth/.

     Because of the half-duplex nature of the medium and the overhead
     generated by CSMA/CA, the actual aggregate throughput is
     typically 50 percent or less of the data rates for 802.11a/b/g
     legacy transmissions, and 60-70 percent of the data rates for
     802.11n/ac transmissions.

       all that apply.)

       A. =FHSS=

       B. =ERP=

       C. =DSSS=

       D. =HR-DSSS=

       *答案解析*
       
       A, B, C and D. The 802.11-2012 standard allows for the use of
       legacy FHSS radios (802.11), legacy DSSS radios (802.11),
       HR-DSSS radios (802.11b), and ERP radios (802.11g).

    4. 802.11n (HT radios) can transmit in which frequency bands?
       (Choose all that apply.)

       A. =2.4 GHz – 2.4835 GHz=

       B. =5.47 GHz – 5.725 GHz=

       C. 902 GHz – 928 GHz

       D. =5.15 GHz – 5.25 GHz=

       *答案解析*

       A, B and D. The 802.11-2012 standard specifies that 802.11n HT
       radios can transmit in the 2.4 GHz ISM band and all four of the
       current 5 GHz U-NII bands. 

    5. In the U-NII-1 band, what is the center frequency of channel
       40?

       A. =5.2 GHz=

       B. 5.4 GHz

       C. 5.8 GHz

       D. 5.140 GHz

       *答案解析*

       A. The U-NII-1 band is between 5.15 GHz and 5.25 GHz, 5,150 MHz
       to 5,250 MHz. To calculate the frequency in MHz from the
       channel, multiply the channel by 5 (200) and then add 5,000 for
       a center frequency of 5,200 MHz, or 5.2 GHz. 

    6. What is the channel and band of a Wi-Fi transmission whose
       center frequency is 5.300 GHz?

       A. U-NII-1 channel 30

       B. U-NII-1 channel 60

       C. U-NII-2 channel 30

       D. =U-NII-2 channel 60=

       *答案解析*

       D. To calculate the channel, first take the frequency in MHz
       (5,300 MHz). Subtract 5,000 from the number (300) and then
       divide the number by 5, resulting in channel 60.The U-NII-2
       band is between 5.25 GHz and 5.35 GHz. 

    7. The 802.11-2012 standard requires how much separation between
       center frequencies for HR-DSSS channels to be considered
       nonoverlapping? 

       A. 22 MHz

       B. =25 MHz=

       C. 30 MHz

       D. 35 MHz

       E. 40 MHz

       *答案解析*

       B. HR-DSSS was introduced under the 802.11b amendment, which
       states that channels need a minimum of 25 MHz of separation
       between the center frequencies to be considered nonoverlapping.

    8. What best describes hop time?

       A. The period of time that the transmitter waits before hopping
       to the next frequency

       B. The period of time that the standard requires when hopping
       between frequencies

       C. =The period of time that the transmitter takes to hop to the
       next frequency=

       D. The period of time the transmitter takes to hop through all
       of the FHSS frequencies

       *答案解析*

       C. The time that the transmitter waits before hopping to the
       next frequency is known as the dwell time. The hop time is not
       a required time but rather a measurement of how long the hop
       takes. 

    9. As defined by the IEEE-2012 standard, how much separation is
       needed between center frequencies of channels in the U-NII-2
       Extended band?

       A. 10 MHz

       B. =20 MHz=

       C. 22 MHz

       D. 25 MHz

       E. 30 MHz

       *答案解析*

       B. The 802.11a amendment, which originally defined the use of
       OFDM, required only 20 MHz of separation between the center
       frequencies for channels to be considered nonoverlapping. All
       25 channels in the 5 GHz U-NII bands use OFDM and have 20 MHz
       of separation. Therefore, all 5 GHz OFDM channels are
       considered nonoverlapping by the IEEE. However, it should be
       noted that adjacent 5 GHz channels do have some sideband
       carrier frequency overlap. 

    10. When deploying an 802.11g (ERP-OFDM) wireless network with
        only two access points, which of these channel groupings would
        be considered nonoverlapping? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. Channels 1 and 3

        B. Channels 7 and 10

        C. =Channels 3 and 8=

        D. =Channels 5 and 11=

        E. Channels 6 and 10

        *答案解析*

        C and D. In order for two ERP or HR-DSSS channels to be
        considered nonoverlapping, they require 25 MHz of separation
        between the center frequencies. Therefore, any two channels
        must have at least a five-channel separation. The simplest way
        to determine what other channels are valid is to add 5 or
        subtract 5 from the channel you want to use. If you added 5,
        then the number you calculated or any channel above that
        number is valid. If you subtracted 5, then the number you
        calculated or any channel below that number is
        valid. Deployments of three or more access points in the 2.4
        GHz ISM band normally use channels 1, 6, and 11, which are all
        considered nonoverlapping. 

    11. Which spread spectrum technology specifies data rates of 22
        Mbps and 33 Mbps?

        A. DSSS

        B. =ERP-PBCC=

        C. OFDM

        D. PPtP

        *答案解析*

        B. Extended Rate Physical Packet Binary Convolutional Code
        (ERP-PBCC) is the optional modulation technique that specifies
        data rates of 22 and 33 Mbps. 

    12. If data is corrupted by previous data from a reflected signal,
        this is known as what?

        A. Delay spread

        B. =ISI=

        C. Forward error creation

        D. Bit crossover

        *答案解析*

        B. The cause of the problem is delay spread resulting in
        intersymbol interference (ISI), which causes data corruption. 

    13. Assuming all channels are supported by a 5 GHz access point,
        how many possible 20 MHz channels can be configured on the
        access point? 

        A. 4

        B. 11

        C. 12

        D. =25=

        *答案解析*

        D. The 802.11-2012 standard states that “the OFDM PHY shall
        operate in the 5 GHz band, as allocated by a regulatory body
        in its operational region.” A total of twentyfive 20 MHz wide
        channels are available in the U-NII bands. 

    14. Which of these technologies is the most resilient against the
        negative effects of multipath?

        A. FHSS

        B. DSSS

        C. HR-DSSS

        D. =OFDM=

        *答案解析*

        D. Because of the lower subcarrier data rates, delay spread is
        a smaller percentage of the symbol period, which means that
        ISI is less likely to occur. In other words, OFDM technology
        is more resistant to the negative effects of multipath than
        DSSS and FHSS spread spectrum technologies.

    15. HR-DSSS calls for data rates of 5.5 Mbps, and 11 Mbps. What is
        the average amount of aggregate throughput percentage at any
        data rate when legacy 802.11a/b/g radios are transmitting?

        A. 80 percent

        B. 75 percent

        C. =50 percent=

        D. 100 percent

        *答案解析*

        C. A medium access method known as Carrier Sense Multiple
        Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) helps to ensure that
        only one radio can be transmitting on the medium at any given
        time. Because of the half-duplex nature of the medium and the
        overhead generated by CSMA/CA, the actual aggregate throughput
        is typically 50 percent or less of the data rate when using
        legacy 802.11a/b/g radios. The aggregate throughput of
        802.11n/ac radios is about 65 percent. 

    16. What are the names of the two additional U-NII bands proposed
        by the FCC that provide for 195 MHz of additional spectrum at
        5 GHz? (Choose all that apply.) 

        A. U-NII-1

        B. U-NII-2A

        C. =U-NII-2B=

        F. =U-NII-4=

        *答案解析*

        C and F. The FCC has proposed two new U-NII bands. A new 120
        MHz wide band called U-NII-2B occupies the frequency space of
        5.35 GHz – 5.47 GHz with six potential 20 MHz
        channels. Another new 75 MHz wide band called U-NII-4 occupies
        the 5.85 GHz – 5.925 GHz frequency space with the potential of
        four more 20 MHz channels.

    17. In the United States, 802.11 radios were not allowed to
        transmit on which range of frequencies to avoid interference
        with Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) systems? 

        A. 5.15 GHz – 5.25 GHz

        B. 5.25 GHz – 5.25 GHz

        C. =5.60 GHz – 5.65 GHz=

        D. 5.85 GHz – 5.925 GHz

        *答案解析*

        C. In 2009, the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) reported
        interference to Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR)
        systems. As a result, the FCC suspended certification of
        802.11 devices in the U-NII-2 and U-NII-2E bands that require
        DFS. Eventually certification was re-established, however, the
        rules changed and 802.11 radios are currently were not allowed
        to transmit in the 5.60 - 5.65 GHz frequency space where TDWR
        operates. Channels 120 -128 were not available for a number of
        years. As of April 2014, the TDWR frequency space is once
        again available for 802.11 transmissions in the United States.

    18. What are the modulation types used by OFDM technology? (Choose

        B. =Phase=

        C. Frequency

        D. Hopping

        *答案解析*

        A and B. OFDM uses BPSK and QPSK modulation for the lower ODFM
        data rates. The higher OFDM data rates use 16-QAM, 64-QAM, and
        256-QAM modulation. QAM modulation is a hybrid of phase and
        amplitude modulation. 

    19. The Barker code converts a bit of data into a series of bits
        that are referred to as what?

        A. Chipset

        B. 52

        =C. 48=

        D. 36

        *答案解析*

        C. A 20 MHz OFDM channel uses 52 subcarriers, but only 48 of
        them are used to transport data. The other 4 subcarriers are used as pilot carriers.

    a non-IEEE-802.11 LAN via a portal.

    通常情况下，会涉及802.11与802.3帧转换。

*** Distribution System

    a /distribution system/ (DS) that is used to interconnect a set of
    basic service sets (BSSs) via integrated LANs to create an
    extended service set。 

    The DS consists of two main components:
    
    1. Distribution System Medium (DSM)
       A logical physical medium used to connect access points is
       known as a distribution system medium (DSM).  802.3 medium是一
       个例子。

    2. Distribution System Services (DSS)

       通常构建上AP里面，以软件的形式存在。 使用802.11头部的Layer 2层
       的地址，将Layer3~7的信息转发到Integration Service或其他的无线
       STA。

*** Wireless Distribution System

    The 802.11-2012 standard defines a mechanism for wireless
    communication using a four-MAC-address frame format.

    The standard describes such a frame format but does not describe
    how such a mechanism or frame format would be used. This mechanism
    is known as a /wireless distribution system (WDS)/.

    WDS examples: bridging(AP without beacon sending), repeaters(AP with beacon sending), mesh networks.

*** Service Set Identifier

    The service set identifier (SSID) is a logical name used ton
    identify an 802.11 wireless network.  不超过32个字符。

*** Basic Service Set

    The basic service set (BSS) is the cornerstone topology of an
    802.11 network. The communicating devices that make up a BSS
    consist of one AP radio with one or more client stations.

*** Basic Service Set Identifier

    AP的48比特（6字节）的MAC地址，也称为BSSID。

*** Basic Service Area

    The physical area of coverage provided by an access point in a BSS
    is known as the basic /service area (BSA)/.

*** Extended Service Set

    An extended service set is two or more basic service sets
    connected by a distribution system medium.

*** Independent Basic Service Set

    The radios that make up an IBSS network consist solely of client
    stations (STAs), and no access point is deployed.

*** Mesh Basic Service Set

    When access points support mesh functions, they may be deployed
    where wired network access is not possible

    The mesh functions are used to provide wireless distribution of
    network traffic, and the set of APs that provide mesh
    distribution form a mesh basic service set (MBSS).

*** QoS Basic Service Set

    Quality of service (QoS) mechanisms can be implemented within all
    of the 802.11 service sets.

** 802.11 Configuration Modes

*** Access Point Modes

    default is root mode. 

    =Bridge Mode=   The AP radio is converted into a wireless
    bridge. This typically adds extra MAC-layer intelligence to the
    device and gives the AP the capability to learn and maintain
    tables about MAC addresses from the wired side of the network.

    =Workgroup Bridge Mode=  The AP radio is transformed into a
    workgroup bridge which provides wireless backhaul for connected
    802.3 wired clients. 

    =Repeater Mode= The AP radio performs as a
    repeater AP which extends the coverage area of a portal AP on the
    same channel.

    =Mesh Mode=  The AP radio operates as a wireless backhaul radio
    for a mesh environment. Depending on the vendor, the backhaul
    radio may also allow for client access.

    =Scanner Mode= The AP radio is converted into a sensor radio,
    allowing the AP to integrate into a wireless intrusion detection
    system (WIDS) architecture. An AP in scanner mode is in a
    continuous listening state while hopping between multiple
    channels. Scanner mode is also often referred to as monitor mode.

*** Client Station Modes

    - infrastructure mode
    - Ad Hoc mode

** Review Questions

    1. An 802.11 wireless network name is known as which type of
       address? (Choose all that apply.)

       A. BSSID

       B. MAC address

       C. IP address

       D. =SSID=

       E. =Extended service set identifier=

       *答案解析*

       D and E. The service set identifier (SSID) is a 32-character,
       case-sensitive, logical name used to identify a wireless
       network. An extended service set identifier (ESSID) is the
       logical network name used in an extended service set. ESSID is
       often synonymous with SSID.

    2. Which two 802.11 topologies require the use of an access point?

       A. WPAN

       B. IBSS

       C. =Basic service set=

       D. Ad hoc

       E. =ESS=

       *答案解析*

       C and E. The 802.11 standard defines four service sets, or
       topologies. A basic service set (BSS) is defined as one AP and
       associated clients. An extended service set (ESS) is defined as
       one or more basic service sets connected by a distribution
       system medium. An independent basic service set (IBSS) does not
       use an AP and consists solely of client stations (STAs).

    3. The 802.11 standard defines which medium to be used in a
       distribution system (DS)?

       A. 802.3 Ethernet

       B. 802.15

       C. 802.5 token ring

       D. Star-bus topology

       E. =None of the above=

       *答案解析*
       
       E. By design, the 802.11 standard does not specify a medium to
       be used in the distribution system. The distribution system
       medium (DSM) may be an 802.3 Ethernet backbone, an 802.5 token
       ring network, a wireless medium, or any other medium. 

    4. Which option is a wireless computer topology used for
       communication of computer devices within close proximity of a

       E. Distribution system

       *答案解析*

       A, C and D. The size and shape of a basic service area can
       depend on many variables, including AP transmit power, antenna
       gain, and physical surroundings. 

    7. What is the default configuration mode that allows an AP radio
       to operate in a basic service set?

       A. Scanner

       B. Repeater

       C. =Root=

       D. Access

       E. Nonroot

       *答案解析*

       C. The normal default setting of an access point is root mode,
       which allows the AP to transfer data back and forth between the
       DS and the 802.11 wireless medium. The default root
       configuration of an AP allows it to operate inside a basic
       service set (BSS). 

    8. Which terms describe an 802.11 topology involving STAs but no
       access points? (Choose all that apply.)

       C. DSSS

       D. Infrastructure

       E. =IBSS=

       F. =Peer-to-peer=

       *答案解析*

       B, E and F. The 802.11 standard defines an independent basic
       service set (IBSS) as a service set using client peer-to-peer
       communications without the use of an AP. Other names for an
       IBSS include ad hoc and peer-to-peer. 

    9. STAs operating in Infrastructure mode may communicate in which

       *答案解析*

       A and D. Clients that are configured in Infrastructure mode may
       communicate via the AP with other wireless client stations
       within a BSS. Clients may also communicate through the AP with
       other networking devices that exist on the distribution system
       medium, such as a server or a wired desktop. 

    10. Which of these are included in the four topologies defined by

        E. =BSS=

        *答案解析*

        B, C and E. The BSSID is the layer 2 identifier of either a
        BSS or an IBSS service set. The 48-bit (6-octet) MAC address
        of an access point’s radio is the basic service set
        identifier (BSSID) within a BSS. An ESS topology utilizes
        multiple access points, thus the existence of multiple
        BSSIDs. In an IBSS network, the first station that powers up
        randomly generates a virtual BSSID in the MAC address
        format. FHSS and HR-DSSS are spread spectrum technologies. 

    14. Which 802.11 service set defines mechanisms for mesh
        networking?

        *答案解析*
        
        D. The 802.11s-2011 amendment, which is now part of the
        802.11-2012 standard, defined a new service set for an 802.11
        mesh topology. When access points support mesh functions, they
        may be deployed where wired network access is not
        possible. The mesh functions are used to provide wireless
        distribution of network traffic, and the set of APs that
        provide mesh distribution form a mesh basic service set
        (MBSS). 

    15. What method of dialog communications is used within an 802.11
        WLAN?

        A. Simplex communications

        C. Full-duplex communications

        D. Dual-duplex communications

        *答案解析*

        B. In half-duplex communications, both devices are capable of
        transmitting and receiving; however, only one device can
        transmit at a time. Walkie-talkies, or two-way radios, are
        examples of half-duplex devices. IEEE 802.11 wireless networks
        use half-duplex communications.

    16. What are some operational modes in which an AP radio may be
        configured? (Choose all that apply.)

        network (WLAN) standard. 802.11 hardware can, however, be
        utilized in other wireless topologies. 
     
* 第八章 802.11媒介访问
** CSMA/CA vs. CSMA/CD

   由于802.11媒介是半双工的方式进行数据传输，所以不能采用Ethernet中
   使用的CSMA/CD方法主动去检测是否有冲突发生。802.11会通过CSMA/CA的方
   式来判断是否有其他STA在进行数据传输，确保任何时刻，只有一个STA在使
   用媒介进行传输。

   如果检测到其他STA在进行数据传输，当前STA会随机选择一个退避时间，并
   进行等待，在等待期间，也会随时监测是否有其他STA在进行数据传输。
   CSMA/CA只是确保任何时刻只有一个802.11设备在进行数据传输，但是仍然无
   法避免冲突的产生，所以，在802.11规范中，定义了DCF功能，来作为媒介访
   问方法去确保冲突最小化。

** Collision Detection

   802.11的单播帧必须得到确认。 802.11n和802.11ac可以使用帧聚合，对聚
   合帧可以使用 Block确认帧。绝大多数的单播帧都需要得到确认，多播或组
   播帧不需要得到确认。单播帧的任何部分的内容被破坏的话，通过CRC都能够
   检测出来，这样接收方就不会发送Ack帧给发送方。 发送方如果收到不确认
   帧，就会假设发送失败，之后会对该帧进行重传。

   1. Interframe space
   2. Duration/ID field
   3. Carrier sense
   4. Random backoff timer

*** Interframe Space (IFS)

    /Interframe space (IFS)/ is a period of time that exists between
    transmissions of wireless frames. There are six types of
    interframe spaces, which are listed here in order of shortest to
    longest:
    1. Reduced interframe space (RIFS), highest priority
    2. Short interframe space (SIFS), second highest priority
    3. PCF interframe space (PIFS), middle priority
    4. DCF interframe space (DIFS), lowest priority
    5. Arbitration interframe space (AIFS), used by QoS stations
    6. Extended interframe space (EIFS), used after receipt of
       corrupted frames

    上述的帧间间隔实际的时间大小取决于网络的传输速度。

    [[./images/2015/2015113050.png]]

*** Duration/ID Field

    该值的大小范围为：0 ~ 32,767。 该域的值表示RF媒体还需要保持多久忙
    碌状态，其他的STA才能竞争使用RF媒介。 

    在大部分情况下，Duration/ID域的值是代表一个媒介占用时间的值， 用
    于重置其他STA的网络分配向量（NAV）的值。 在极少情况下，如PS-Poll
    帧中，Duration/ID的值作为使用传统电源管理的STA的一个ID值。

*** Carrier Sense

    对于802.11 CSMA/CA设备，在进行数据传输之前，需要执行一下载波侦听，
    用于检查当前媒介是否处于忙碌状态。主要有两种方法：

    1. 虚拟载波侦听。

       虚拟载波侦听使用了一种计时器机制，称之为 /network allocation
       vector(NAV)/ 。 NAV计时器会根据上一次帧传输的 =Duration= 值，
       预测接下来需要占用媒介的时间。

       当802.11设备没有进行数据传输时，它会进行监听，当它监听到从其他
       STA传送过来的帧时，会查看帧的头部信息，看Duration/ID域是否包含
       =Duration= 值或一个ID值。 当它表示一个 =Duration= 值时，监听帧
       的这个设备会将自己的NAV计时器设置为读到的值，然后启用计时器倒
       数，直到计时器的值变为0。 在此之前，该STA都不能去竞争媒介的访
       问权。 

       #+CAPTION: Virtual carrier sense
       [[./images/2015/2015113051.png]]

    2. 物理载波侦听。

       Physical carrier sensing is performed constantly by all
       stations that are not transmitting or receiving. When a
       station performs a physical carrier sense, it is actually
       listening to the channel to see whether any other transmitters
       are taking up the channel.

       虚拟载波侦听工作在Layer 2， 而物理载波侦听工作于Layer 1。 两种
       载波方式可以同时运行。

       Clear Channel Assessment(CCA):  
       1. determine whether a frame transmission is inbound for a station to receive.

       2. determine whether the medium is busy before transmitting.

*** Random Backoff Timer
    
    802.11 STA会在一个竞争窗口(CW)时间竞争媒介的使用权，该窗口期称为
    /backoff time/ 。 工作站选择一个不超过CW值的随机数， 然后再乘以时
    隙时间slot，slot的值跟具体的物理层有关（DSSS、OFDM等）。

    当启动backoff计时器后，只要在某个时隙时间内，媒介上没有数据传输，
    计时器的值就会减掉一个时隙时间。如果物理载波或虚拟载波侦听机制检
    测到媒介处于忙碌状态，那么该计时器就会暂停。 当媒介空闲时间大于
    DIFS, AIFS或EIFS，backoff计时器会重新倒计时。 一次不成功的传输会
    导致CW的大小成指数倍增长。

    如下是退避机制的一个例子：
    1. An OFDM station selects a random number from a contention
       window of 0–15. For this example, the number chosen is 4.
    2. The station multiplies the random number of 4 by a slot time of 9μs.
    3. The random backoff timer has a value of 36μs (4 slots).
    4. For every slot time during which there is no medium activity,
       the backoff time is decremented by a slot time.
    5. The station decrements the backoff timer until the timer is zero.
    6. The station transmits if the medium is clear.

** Point Coordination Function

   这是一种Polling的方式。 AP充当点协调者的功能。 PCF只用于一个BSS内
   部。 不能用于Ad Hoc网络（IBSS）， 因为没有AP存在。

   AP和STA都要支持PCF功能，才能使用PCF机制。

   目前，暂时没有实现上述机制的产品面世。 

** Hybrid Coordination Function

   HCF结合了DCF和PCF的功能，并进行了加强，提供了两个访问信道的方法：
   1. Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA)
   2. HCF Controlled Channel Access (HCCA)

   DCF和PCF允许802.11传输单个帧，之后，仍然需要继续竞争媒介去传输下一
   帧。HCF允许一个802.11设备在媒介传输时，发送多个帧。 当支持HCF的设
   备竞争媒介时，它会分配到一段时间，去发送帧，这段时间称为 /transmit
   opportunity (TXOP)/ 。 在此期间，它可以传输多个帧。 在传输这些帧时，
   使用SIFS。

** Block Acknowledgment

   A Block ACK improves channel efficiency by aggregating several
   acknowledgments into one single acknowledgment frame.

** Wi-Fi Multimedia

   The 802.11e amendment defined the layer 2 MAC methods needed to
   meet the QoS requirements for time-sensitive applications over
   IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs. The Wi-Fi Alliance introduced the Wi-Fi
   Multimedia (WMM) certification as a partial mirror of 802.11e
   amendment.

** Airtime Fairness

      在802.11媒介访问过程中，每个设备都需要竞争使用媒介传输数据。 对
      于每个设备来说， 竞争机会均等。 当一个速率高的设备与一个速率低
      的设备同时出现在一个网络中竞争使用媒介时，会降低高速率设备的网
      络吞吐量。 为了解决这样的问题，提出了 =Airtime Fairness= ，主要
      思想是时间分配均等，而不是竞争机会均等, 这样保证了高速率的设备
      能够较快地完成数据传输，不会受到低速率设备的影响。

** Review Questions
    
    1. DCF is also known as what? (Choose all that apply.)
       
         A. Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection
         (CSMA/CD)

         B. =Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA)=

         C. Data Control Function

         D. =Distributed Coordination Function=

       *答案解析*
       
       B and D. DCF is an abbreviation for Distributed Coordination
       Function. CSMA/CA is an 802.11 media access control method that
       is part of DCF. CSMA/CD is used by 802.3, not 802.11. There is
       no such thing as Data Control Function. 

    2. 802.11 collision detection is handled using which technology?
       
       A. Network allocation vector (NAV).

       B. Clear channel assessment (CCA).

       C. Duration/ID value.

       D. Receiving an ACK from the destination station.

       E. =Positive collision detection cannot be determined.=

       *答案解析*

       E. 802.11 technology does not use collision detection. If an
       ACK frame is not received by the original transmitting radio,
       the unicast frame is not acknowledged and will have to be
       retransmitted. This process does not specifically determine
       whether a collision occurs. Failure to receive an ACK frame
       from the receiver means that either a unicast frame was not
       received by the destination station or the ACK frame was not
       received, but it cannot positively determine the cause. It may
       be due to collision or to other reasons such as high noise
       level. All of the other options are used to help prevent collisions.

    3. ACK and CTS-to-self frames follow which interframe space?

       A. EIFS

       B. DIFS

       C. PIFS

       D. =SIFS=

       E. LIFS

       *答案解析*

       D. ACK frames and CTS-to-self frames follow a SIFS. LIFS do not exist.

    4. The carrier sense portion of CSMA/CA is performed by using
       which of the following methods? (Choose all that apply.)

       A. =Virtual carrier sense=

       B. =Physical carrier sense=

       C. Channel sense window

       D. =Clear channel assessment=

       *答案解析*

       A, B and D. The NAV timer maintains a prediction of future
       traffic on the medium based on duration value information seen
       in a previous frame transmission. Virtual carrier sense uses
       the NAV to determine medium availability. Physical carrier
       sense checks the RF medium for carrier availability. Clear
       channel assessment is another name for physical carrier
       sense. Channel sense window does not exist. 

    5. After the station has performed the carrier sense and
       determined that no other devices are transmitting for a period
       of a DIFS interval, what is the next step for the station? 

       A. Wait the necessary number of slot times before transmitting
       if a random backoff value has already been selected.

       B. Begin transmitting.

       C. =Select a random backoff value.=

       D. Begin the random backoff timer.

       *答案解析*

       C. The first step is to select a random backoff value. After
       the value is selected, it is multiplied by the slot time. The
       random backoff timer then begins counting down the number of
       slot times. When the number reaches 0, the station can begin
       transmitting. 

    6. If PCF is implemented, it can function in which of the
       following network environments? (Choose all that apply.)

       A. Ad hoc mode

       B. =BSS=

       C. IBSS

       D. =Infrastructure mode=

       E. BSA

       *答案解析*

       B and D. PCF requires an access point. Ad hoc mode and an
       independent basic service set (IBSS) are the same and do not
       use an access point. A basic service set (BSS) is a WLAN
       topology, where 802.11 client stations communicate through an
       access point. Infrastructure mode is the default client station
       mode that allows clients to communicate via an access
       point. Basic service area (BSA) is the area of coverage of a
       basic service set.

    7. Which of the following terms are affiliated with the virtual
       carrier sense mechanism? (Choose all that apply.)

       A. Contention window

       B. =Network allocation vector=

       C. Random backoff time

       D. =Duration/ID field=

       *答案解析*

       B and D. The Duration/ID field is used to set the network
       allocation vector (NAV), which is a part of the virtual carrier
       sense process. The contention window and random backoff time
       are part of the backoff process that is performed after the
       carrier sense process.
       

    8. The goal of allocating equal time as opposed to equal
       opportunity is known as what?

       A. Access fairness

       B. Opportunistic media access

       C. CSMA/CA

       D. =Airtime fairness=

       *答案解析*

       D. The goal of airtime fairness is to allocate equal time, as
       opposed to equal opportunity. Access fairness and opportunistic
       media access do not exist. CSMA/CA is the normal media access
       control mode for Wi-Fi devices. 

    9. CSMA/CA and DCF define which mechanisms that attempt to ensure
       that only one 802.11 radio can transmit on the half-duplex RF
       medium? (Choose all that apply.) 

       A. =Random backoff timer=

       B. =NAV=

       C. CCMP

       D. =CCA=

       E. =Interframe spacing=

       *答案解析*

       A, B, D and E. DCF defines four checks and balances of CSMA/CA
       and DCF to ensure that only one 802.11 radio is transmitting on
       the half-duplex medium. Virtual carrier sense (NAV), physical
       carrier sense (CCA), interframe spacing, and the random backoff
       timer all work together. CCMP is the encryption protocol that
       was introduced with 802.11i. 

    10. The Wi-Fi Alliance certification called Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM)
        is based on which media access method defined by the
        802.11-2012 standard? 
        
        A. DCF

        B. PCF

        C. =EDCA=

        D. HCCA

        E. HSRP

        *答案解析*
        
        C. Currently, WMM is based on EDCA mechanisms defined by the
        802.11e amendment, which is now part of the 802.11-2012
        standard. The WMM certification provides for traffic
        prioritization via four access categories. EDCA is a
        subfunction of Hybrid Coordination Function (HCF). The other
        subfunction of HCF is HCCA. 

    11. Hybrid Coordination Function (HCF) defines what allotted
        period of time in which a station can transmit multiple
        frames?

        A. Block acknowledgment

        B. Polling

        C. Virtual carrier sense

        D. Physical carrier sense

        E. =TXOP=

        *答案解析*

        E. HCF defines the ability for an 802.11 radio to send
        multiple frames when transmitting on the RF medium. When an
        HCF-compliant radio contends for the medium, it receives an
        allotted amount of time to send frames called a transmit
        opportunity (TXOP). During this TXOP, an 802.11 radio may send
        multiple frames in what is called a frame burst. 

    12. WMM is based on EDCA and provides for traffic prioritization
        via which of the following access categories? (Choose all that
        apply.) 

        A. =WMM Voice priority=

        B. =WMM Video priority=

        C. WMM Audio priority

        D. =WMM Best Effort priority=

        E. =WMM Background priority=

        *答案解析*
        
        A, B, D and E. WMM Audio priority does not exist. The WMM
        certification provides for traffic prioritization via the four
        access categories of Voice, Video, Best Effort, and Background.

    13. The 802.11e amendment (now part of the 802.11-2012 standard)
        defines which of the following medium access methods to
        support QoS requirements? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. Distributed Coordination Function (DCF)

        B. =Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA)=

        C. =Hybrid Coordination Function (HCF)=

        D. Point Coordination Function (PCF)

        E. =Hybrid Coordination Function Controlled Access (HCCA)=

        *答案解析*

        B, C and E. DCF and PCF were defined in the original 802.11
        standard. The 802.11e quality of service amendment added a new
        coordination function to 802.11 medium contention, known as
        Hybrid Coordination Function (HCF). The 802.11e amendment and
        HCF have since been incorporated into the 802.11-2012
        standard. HCF combines capabilities from both DCF and PCF and
        adds enhancements to them to create two channel access
        methods, HCF Controller Channel Access (HCCA) and Enhanced
        Distributed Channel Access (EDCA).

    14. What information that comes from the wired network is used to
        assign traffic into access categories on a WLAN controller?

        A. Duration/ID

        B. =802.1D priority tags=

        C. Destination MAC address

        D. Source MAC address

        *答案解析*

        B. The EDCA medium access method provides for the
        prioritization of traffic via the use of 802.1D priority
        tags. 802.1D tags provide a mechanism for implementing quality
        of service (QoS) at the MAC level. Different classes of
        service are available, represented in a 3-bit user priority
        field in an IEEE 802.1Q header added to an Ethernet
        frame. 802.1D priority tags from the Ethernet side are used to
        direct traffic to different access-category queues.

    15. What are the two reasons that 802.11 radios use physical
        carrier sense? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. =To synchronize incoming transmissions=

        B. To synchronize outgoing transmissions

        C. To reset the NAV

        D. To start the random backoff timer

        E. =To assess the RF medium=

        *答案解析*

        A and E. The first purpose is to determine whether a frame
        transmission is inbound for a station to receive. If the
        medium is busy, the radio will attempt to synchronize with the
        transmission. The second purpose is to determine whether the
        medium is busy before transmitting. This is known as the clear
        channel assessment (CCA). The CCA involves listening for
        802.11 RF transmissions at the Physical layer. The medium must
        be clear before a station can transmit. 

    16. What CSMA/CA mechanism is used for medium contention? (Choose
        all that apply.)

        A. =NAV=

        B. =CCA=

        C. =Random backoff timer=

        D. =Contention window=

        *答案解析*

        A, B, C and D. An 802.11 radio uses a random backoff algorithm
        to contend for the medium during a window of time known as the
        contention window. The contention window is essentially a
        final countdown timer and is also known as the random backoff
        timer. The NAV timer and the clear channel assessment (CCA)
        are also used in the medium contention process to determine
        the availability of the medium. 

    17. Which field in the MAC header of an 802.11 frame resets the
        NAV timer for all listening 802.11 stations?

        A. NAV

        B. Frame control

        C. =Duration/ID=

        D. Sequence number

        E. Strictly ordered bit

        *答案解析*

        C. When the listening radio hears a frame transmission from
        another station, it looks at the header of the frame and
        determines whether the Duration/ID field contains a Duration
        value or an ID value. If the field contains a Duration value,
        the listening station will set its NAV timer to this value.

    18. The EDCA medium access method provides for the prioritization
        of traffic via priority queues that are matched to eight
        802.1D priority tags. What are the EDCA priority queues
        called? 

        A. TXOP

        B. =Access categories=

        C. Priority levels

        D. Priority bits

        E. PT

        *答案解析*

        B. Enhanced Distributed Channel Access provides differentiated
        access for stations  by using four access categories The EDCA
        medium access method provides for the prioritization of
        traffic via the four access categories that are aligned to
        eight 802.1D priority tags.

    19. ACKs are required for which of the following frames?

        A. =Unicast=

        B. Broadcast

        C. Multicast

        D. Anycast

        *答案解析*

        A. ACKS are used for delivery verification of unicast 802.11
        frames. Broadcast and multicast frames do not require an
        acknowledgment. Anycast frames do not exist. 

    20. What QoS mechanism can be used to reduce medium contention
        overhead during a frame burst of low-latency traffic?
        
        A. Delayed Block ACK

        B. Contention period

        C. Contention window

        D. Contention-free period

        E. =Immediate Block ACK=

        *答案解析*

        E. A Block ACK improves channel efficiency by aggregating
        several acknowledgments into one single acknowledgment
        frame. There are two types of Block ACK mechanisms: immediate
        and delayed. The immediate Block ACK is designed for use with
        lowlatency traffic, whereas the delayed Block ACK is more
        suitable for latency-tolerant traffic.

     2. Lower Layer： Physical Medium Dependent (PMD)

        PMD子层进行调制并将数据按比特位进行传输。

*** PLCP Service Data Unit

       PSDU是MPDU物理层的视角，它们仅仅是相同数据在不同OSI层上的展现。

*** PLCP Protocol Data Unit

       当PLCP接收到PSDU，会进行传输前的准备， 并创建PPDU。 PLCP会为
       PSDU增加一段前导码和PHY头部信息。前导码的作用主要是为了发送方与
       接收方之间的同步。当PPDU创建后，PMD子层会将PPDU数据调制成比特位
       传输出去。

       数据链路层到物理层流通的过程：

** 802.11 and 802.3 Interoperability

      802.11标准定义Integration Service（IS）可以使MSDU在DS与非802.11
      LAN之间通过Portal进行传输，其中Portal通常是一个AP或者WLAN控制器。
      用更简单的话说，IS是一种帧格式的传输方式(涉及到例如802.11与802.3帧格
      式之间的转换)。

      IS的主要任务是： 
      
      1. 去除802.11帧的头部和尾部。
      2. 将MSDU的负载放到802.3以太网帧的内部。

      通常IS将帧在802.11和802.3媒介之间传输。当然，也可以将MSDU在
      802.11与其他类型的媒介之间进行传输，如手机数据网。

** Three 802.11 Frame Types
   
      总共有三种类型的帧：管理帧，控制帧和数据帧。

*** Management Frames

    　管理帧又称为 /Management MAC Protocol Data Unit (MMPDU)/ 。 管理
    帧并不携带上层的信息，它只携带Layer2的IE。 802.11总共定义了14种管
    理帧：

       - association request
       - association response
       - association request
       - Reassociation response
       - Probe request
       - Probe response
       - Beacon
       - Announcement traffic indication message (ATIM)
       - Disassociation
       - Authentication
       - Deauthentication
       - Action
       - Action No ACK
       - Timing advertisement

*** Control Frames

      控制帧主要是辅助数据帧的传输。主要用于清空信道，获取信道以及提供
      单播帧的确认。它们只包含头部信息。

      下面是802.11定义的9种控制帧：

       - Power Save Poll (PS-Poll)
       - Request to send (RTS)
       - Clear to send (CTS)
       - Acknowledgment (ACK)
       - Contention Free-End (CF-End) [PCF Only]
       - CF-End + CF-ACK [PCF Only]
       - Block ACK Request (BlockAckReq) [HCF Only]
       - Block ACK (BlockAck) [HCF Only]
       - Control wrapper

*** Data Frames

       数据帧是实际从上层协议传送下来的数据， Layer3~7 MSDU负载通常被
       加密。 802.11定义了15种数据帧：

       - Data (simple data frame)
       - Null function (no data)
       - Data + CF-ACK [PCF only]
       - Data + CF-Poll [PCF only]
       - Data + CF-ACK + CF-Poll [PCF only]
       - CF-ACK (no data) [PCF only]
       - CF-Poll (no data) [PCF only]
       - CF-ACK + CF-Poll (no data) [PCF only]
       - QoS Data [HCF]
       - QoS Null (no data) [HCF]
       - QoS Data + CF-ACK [HCF]
       - QoS Data + CF-Poll [HCF]
       - Qos Data + CF-ACK + CF-Poll [HCF]
       - QoS CF-Poll (no data) [HCF]
       - QoS CF-ACK + CF-Poll (no data) [HCF]

** Beacon Management Frame

     Beacon管理帧是最重要的一种帧，它是无线网络的心跳。 一个BSS中的AP
     会发送Beacon帧，STA则监听Beacon帧。 每个Beacon帧带有时间戳信息，
     可用于STA与AP之间的同步， Beacon帧的主要信息如下图所示：

     #+CAPTION: Beacon frame contents
     [[./images/2015/2015120103.png]]

**** Passive Scanning
     
        在被动扫描中，STA监听从AP发送过来的Beacon帧。
        
        #+CAPTION: Passive scanning
        [[./images/2015/2015120104.png]]

**** Active Scanning

        STA主动发送Probe Request请求，然后监控AP的Probe Response帧。

        #+CAPTION: Active scanning
        [[./images/2015/2015120105.png]]

** Authentication

      802.11下的Authentication相当于“插上网线”的步骤， 主要是认证双方
      是否合法的802.11设备，仅此而已。

      802.11定义了两种不同的认证方式：
      1. Open System Authentication (not used any more, only a legacy
         process now)
      2. Shared Key Authentication (used for backward compatibility)

**** Open System Authentication

        It is essentially an exchange of hellos between the client and
        the AP。 

**** Shared Key Authentication

       Steps:

       1. The client station sends an authentication request to the AP.
       2. The AP sends a clear-text challenge to the client station in
          an authentication response.
       3. The client station then encrypts the clear-text challenge and
          sends it back to the AP in the body of another
          authentication request frame.
       4. The AP then decrypts the station’s response and compares it
          to the challenge text. If they match, the AP will respond by
          sending a fourth and final authentication frame the station,
          confirming the success. If they do not match, the AP will
          respond negatively. If the AP cannot decrypt the challenge,
          it will also respond negatively.

       如果认证成功，则相同的Static WEP key也会被用于加密数据帧。

       这种方式有缺陷， 更安全的方案是PSK和802.1X/EAP。

** Association

     当STA与AP进行完Auth交互后，下一步就是与AP关联。当一个STA与AP关联
     后，它就成为了一个BSS中的成员。这样STA就可以通过AP将数据发送到DS
     媒介。

     STA通过发送Assocation Request来请求加入一个BSS， AP通过发送
     Association Response给STA，拒绝或同意STA的加入。

*** Authentication and Association States

      #+CAPTION: Authentication and association states
      [[./images/2015/2015120201.png]]
      
*** Basic and Supported Rates

      AP可以设置 =基本速率集= 和 =可支持的速率集= 。 每个与AP关联的STA必
      须表明它支持AP的 =基本速率集= ，否则就会被AP拒绝关联。 而 =可支
      持的速率集=  是AP建议的一些速率，STA可以不支持。 

      HR-DSSS (802.11b)支持的速率集为：1, 2, 5.5, and 11 Mbps  

      ERP (802.11g)支持的速率集为： 1, 2, 5.5, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36,
      48和54 Mbps。 

*** Roaming

      漫游：在保持上层连接不中断的情况下，STA从一个AP转到另一个AP所在
      的BSS中。

      漫游的决定是由STA来决定。一个STA可以同时与多个AP进行Auth交互，但
      是只能与其中一个AP关联。 

      当漫游发生后，旧AP与新AP之间也需要通过DS媒介来交互一些信息，即新
      AP要通知旧的AP, 与旧AP关联的STA目前准备与新的AP关联,请转发一些发往STA的数据给新的AP,并进行一些清理动
      作， 将之前为之缓存的数据发给新的AP。

*** Reassociation

      当一个STA发生漫游后，就会发送Reassociation Request给新的AP，
      Reassociation是指重新关联到无线网络的SSID，而不是指重新关联到某
      个AP。

      #+CAPTION: Reassociation process
      [[./images/2015/2015120203.png]]

*** Disassociation

      Disassociation是一个通知，并不是请求，通信双方必须接收，不能拒绝。
      AP和STA都可以发送。

*** Deauthentication
    
      Deauthentication也是一个通知，通信双方必须接收，不能拒绝，AP和
      STA都可以发送。

** ACK Frame

     ACK帧是802.11 CSMA/CA机制的一个核心组件，每个单播帧都必须通过ACK
     帧来确认发送是否成功。ACK帧主要用于发送过程的确认动作。 

** Fragmentation

     802.11支持帧分片， 分片是将一个大的帧分成较小的帧，这些较小的帧也
     是一个个802.11帧，都包含MAC Header信息，可以单独传输，并需要ACK确
     认。

     传输过程使用SIFS。在网络环境比较好的情况下，数据帧分片会降低网络
     吞吐量，因为增加了网络传输的开销。但是，在网络环境比较差的情况下，
     数据传输错误率较高的情况下，数据帧分片则会改善网络吞吐量。

     #+CAPTION: Frame fragmentation
     [[./images/2015/2015120204.png]]

** Protection Mechanism

    在同一个BSS中存在802.11b  802.11g 或者802.11n, 802.11ac设备时，支
    持更高速率的设备会启用保护机制。

*** RTS/CTS

       Request to send/clear to send (RTS/CTS) is a mechanism that
       performs a NAV distribution and helps prevent collisions from
       occurring.

       RTS/CTS都会使监听它们的工作站更新NAV的值。

       RTS/CTS主要用于两种情况：

       1. 隐藏结点。
       2. 当一个BSS中同时存在802.11b/g/n设备。

*** CTS-to-Self

      CTS-to-Self is used strictly as a protection mechanism for
      mixed-mode environments. One of the benefits of using
      CTS-to-Self over RTS/CTS as a protection mechanism is that the
      throughput will be higher because fewer frames are being sent.

      想比RTS/CTS，开销要小点。一般AP会使用CTS-to-Self作为保护机制。
      STA也可以选择CTS-to-Self作为保护机制。

** Data Frames

     空数据帧一般用于通知AP当前STA处于省电状态。

** Power Management
     
*** Active Mode

      处于非省电状态，对于直接接电源的STA，应该配置为Active Mode。

*** Power Save Mode

      当STA处于省电状态时，应该将Power Management位置为1. 

*** Traffic Indication Map

      当关联到某个AP的STA进入省电模式时，它会发送一个Null数据帧，这个
      帧的Power Management位会被置为1， AP收到后，就知道该STA进入省电
      状态，随后就会为它缓存发往该STA的帧。AP通过AID来跟踪该STA。当AP
      传递下一个Beacon帧时，会在TIM域中显示该STA是否有缓存帧。TIM域保
      存了所有在AP中缓存帧的STA列表，且会一直显示，直到缓存帧全部发送
      完成。

      Beacon帧传送的时间周期是预知的，这个时间称为 /target beacon
      transmission time (TBTT)/ 。 STA知道什么时候Beacon会到来，但是一
      般不必醒过来监听每个Beacon帧，可以选择隔几个Beacon帧听一次，这个
      时间是由 /Listen Interval/ 来指定的。 

      当STA听到AP发送过来的Beacon帧，它会Check  TIM域对应的比特位是否
      为1， 如果为1，则说明AP会为该STA缓存帧。 STA通过PS-Poll向AP请求
      缓存的数据帧。 AP会将缓存帧不停发送给STA直到全部发送完毕。之后，
      STA可以继续进入PS状态。

      
*** Delivery Traffic Indication Message

       除了单播数据，网络中也会存在多播数据和广播数据，由于多播和广播
       数据是针对所有STA的，BSS需要提供一种方法以确保所有STA都能及时醒
       来接收这些帧。 /DTIM/ 用于确保当BSS中有设备发送广播或单播数据时，
       所有具备Power Management功能的STA都能及时醒来接收。 DTIM是一种
       特别类型的TIM，通过Beacon帧来传递。

       =DTIM Interval= 决定了DTIM Beacon传输的时间周期。为3时，表示每3个
       Beacon帧，会传递一次DTIM信息。 每个 TIM会有一个倒数计数器，来指
       定下一个DTIM何时到达，当TIM的倒数计数器值为0时，表示当前的TIM是
       DTIM。

       只要BSS中有任何一个STA进入休眠状态，AP都会缓存广播或多播帧。 缓
       存的广播或多播帧会使用AID 0保存。 AP会在每次发送DTIM帧后，发送
       广播和多播数据（如果有的话）。

*** Announcement Traffic Indication Message

       在一个IBSS网络，没有中心的AP。 一个STA进入PS模式时，需要通知其
       他的STA自己已经进入PS Mode状态，其他STA会缓存发往该STA的帧。

       所有的STA都必须周期性地醒来，相互通知是否有STA缓存了发住其他STA
       的帧。这个期间，所有STA都必须是Active状态，相互交换的信息的时间
       段称为
       /announcement traffic  indication message (ATIM) window/ 。在
       ATIM Window期间， 只能传输如下的控制帧和管理帧： Beacon, RTS,
       CTS, ACK和ATIM帧。  如
       果一个STA1缓存了另一个STA2的帧，STA1会发送一个ATIM帧给STA2， 该
       ATIM单播帧告诉STA2必须保持活跃状态直到下一个ATIM Window结束，这样它
       才能接收缓存的数据。 任何缓存其他STA数据的STA或收到ATIM帧的STA
       都必须保持活跃状态，其他的STA则可以进入PS模式。

       一旦ATIM Window结束，所有未休眠的STA会经历CSMA/CA过程去交换未发
       送的数据。 如果某个STA本次无法发送缓存的数据，需要在下一个ATIM
       Window再发送一个ATIM帧，然后在ATIM Window结束后，再次经历一个
       CSMA/CA过程重新发送数据。 
       
       
*** WMM Power Save and U-APSD

       #+CAPTION: Legacy power management
       [[./images/2015/2015120801.png]]


       WMM-PS uses a trigger mechanism to receive buffered unicast
       traffic based on WMM access categories.

       #+CAPTION: WMM-PS
       [[./images/2015/2015120802.png]]

       The advantages of this enhanced power-management method include
       the following:

       1. Applications now control the power-save behavior by setting
          doze periods and sending trigger frames. VoWiFi phones will
          obviously send triggers to the AP frequently during voice
          calls, whereas a laptop radio using a data application will
          have a longer doze period.

       2. The trigger and delivery method eliminates the need for
          PS-Poll frames.

       3. The client can request to download buffered traffic and does
          not have to wait for a beacon frame.

       4. All the downlink application traffic is sent in a faster
          frame burst during the AP’s TXOP.

       使用的前提：
       
       1. The client is Wi-Fi CERTIFIED for WMM-PS.
       2. The AP is Wi-Fi CERTIFIED for WMM-PS.

*** 802.11n Power Management

       802.11n定义了两个新的Power-Management方法：
       
       1. spatial multiplexing power save (SM power save).

          The purpose of SM power save is to enable a MIMO 802.11n
          device to power down all but one of its radio chains.

       2. power save multi-poll (PSMP)

          defined for use for HT (802.11n) radios。

** Review Questions
    
    1. What is the difference between association frames and
       reassociation frames?

       A. Association frames are management frames, whereas
       reassociation frames are control frames.

       B. Association frames are used exclusively for roaming.

       C. =Reassociation frames contain the BSSID of the original AP.=

       D. Only association frames are used to join a BSS.

       *答案解析*

       C. Both frames are used to join a BSS. Reassociation frames are
       used during the roaming process. The reassociation frame
       contains an additional field called Current AP Address. This
       address is the BSSID of the original AP that the client is
       leaving. 

    2. Which of the following contains only LLC data and the IP packet
       but does not include any 802.11 data?

       A. MPDU

       B. PPDU

       C. PSDU

       D. =MSDU=

       E. MMPDU

       *答案解析*

       D. An IP packet consists of layer 3–7 information. The MAC
       Service Data Unit (MSDU) contains data from the LLC sublayer
       and/or any number of layers above the Data-Link layer. The MSDU
       is the payload found inside the body of 802.11 data frames

    3. Which of the following are protection mechanisms? (Choose all
       that apply.)

       A. NAV back-off

       B. =RTS/CTS=

       C. RTS-to-Self

       D. =CTS-to-Self=

       E. WEP encryption

       *答案解析*

       B and D. RTS/CTS and CTS-to-Self provide 802.11g protection
       mechanisms, sometimes referred to as mixed-mode support. NAV
       back-off and RTS-to-Self do not exist. WEP encryption provides
       data security. 

    4. The presence of what type of transmissions can trigger the
       protection mechanism within an ERP basic service set? (Choose
       all that apply.)

       A. =Association of an HR-DSSS client=

       B. Association of an ERP-OFDM client

       C. =HR-DSSS beacon frame=

       D. =ERP beacon frame with the =NonERP_Present= bit set to 1

       E. Association of an FHSS client

       *答案解析*

       A, C and D. An ERP AP signals for the use of the protection
       mechanism in the ERP information element in the beacon
       frame. If a non-ERP STA associates to an ERP AP, the ERP AP
       will enable the =NonERP_Present= bit in its own beacons, enabling
       protection mechanisms in its BSS. In other words, an HR-DSSS
       (802.11b) client association will trigger protection. If an ERP
       AP hears a beacon with only an 802.11b or 802.11 supported rate
       set from another AP or an IBSS STA, it will enable the
       =NonERP_Present= bit in its own beacons, enabling protection
       mechanisms in its BSS. 
       
    5. Which of the following information is included in a probe
       response frame? (Choose all that apply.)

       A. =Time stamp=

       B. =Supported data rates=

       C. =Service set capabilities=

       D. =SSID=

       E. Traffic indication map

       *答案解析*

       A, B, C and D. The probe response contains the same information
       as the beacon frame, with the exception of the traffic indication map.

    6. Which of the following are true about beacon management frames?
       (Choose all that apply.)

       A. Beacons can be disabled to hide the network from intruders.

       B. =Time-stamp information is used by the clients to synchronize their clocks.=

       C. In a BSS, clients share the responsibility of transmitting
       the beacons.

       D. =Beacons can contain vendor-proprietary information.=

       *答案解析*

       B and D. Beacons cannot be disabled. Clients use the time-stamp
       information from the beacon to synchronize with the other
       stations on the wireless network. Only APs send beacons in a
       BSS; client stations send beacons in an IBSS. Beacons can
       contain proprietary information.

    7. If WMM-PS is not supported, after a station sees its AID set to
       1 in the TIM, what typically is the next frame that the station
       transmits?

       A. CTS

       B. =PS-Poll=

       C. ATIM

       D. ACK

       *答案解析*

       B. If a station finds its AID in the TIM, there is unicast data
       on the AP that the station needs to stay awake for and request
       to have downloaded. This request is performed by a PS-Poll frame.

    8. When a station sends an RTS, the Duration/ID field notifies the
       other stations that they must set their NAV timers to which of
       the following values? 

       A. 213 microseconds

       B. The time necessary to transmit the DATA and ACK frames

       C. The time necessary to transmit the CTS frame

       D. =The time necessary to transmit the CTS, DATA, and ACK
       frames=

       *答案解析*

       D. When the RTS frame is sent, the value of the Duration/ID
       field is equal to the time necessary for the CTS, DATA, and ACK
       frames to be transmitted. 

    9. How does a client station indicate that it is using Power Save
       mode?

       A. It transmits a frame to the AP with the Sleep field set
       to 1.

       B. =It transmits a frame to the AP with the Power Management
       field set to 1.=

       C. Using DTIM, the AP determines when the client station uses
       Power Save mode.

       D. It doesn’t need to, because Power Save mode is the default.

       *答案解析*

       B. When the client station transmits a frame with the Power
       Management field set to 1, it is enabling Power Save mode. The
       DTIM does not enable Power Save mode; it only notifies clients
       to stay awake in preparation for a multicast or broadcast. 

    10. What would cause an 802.11 station to retransmit a unicast
        frame? (Choose all that apply.) 

        A. =The transmitted unicast frame was corrupted.=

        B. =The ACK frame from the receiver was corrupted.=

        C. The receiver’s buffer was full.

        D. The transmitting station will never attempt to retransmit
        the data frame.

        E. The transmitting station will send a retransmit
        notification.

        *答案解析*

        A and B. The receiving station may have received the data, but
        the returning ACK frame may have become corrupted and the
        original unicast frame will have to be retransmitted. If the
        unicast frame becomes corrupted for any reason, the receiving
        station will not send an ACK. 

    11. If a station is in Power Save mode, how does it know that the
        AP has buffered unicast frames waiting for it?

        A. By examining the PS-Poll frame

        B. =By examining the TIM field=

        C. When it receives an ATIM

        D. When the Power Management bit is set to 1

        E. From the DTIM interval

        *答案解析*

        B. The PS-Poll frame is used by the station to request cached
        data. The ATIM is used to notify stations in an IBSS of cached
        data. The Power Management bit is used by the station to
        notify the AP that the station is going into Power Save
        mode. The DTIM is used to indicate to client stations how
        often to wake up to receive buffered broadcast and multicast
        frames. The traffic indication map (TIM) is a field in the
        beacon frame used by the AP to indicate that there are
        buffered unicast frames for clients in Power Save mode.

    12. When is an ERP (802.11g) AP required by the IEEE 802.11-2012
        standard to respond to probe request frames from nearby
        HR-DSSS (802.11b) stations? (Choose all that apply.) 

        A. =When the probe request frames contain a null SSID value=

        B. When the AP supports only ERP-OFDM data rates

        C. When the AP supports only HR/DSSS data rates

        D. When the Power Management bit is set to 1

        E. =When the probe request frames contain the correct SSID
        value=

        *答案解析*

        A and E. All 802.11 APs are required to respond to directed
        probe request frames that contain the correct SSID value. The
        AP must also respond to null probe request frames that contain
        a blank SSID value. Some vendors offer the capability to
        respond to null probe requests with a null probe response. 

    13. Which of the following are true about scanning? (Choose all
        that apply.)

        A. =There are two types of scanning: passive and active.=

        B. Stations must transmit probe requests in order to learn
        about local APs.

        C. The 802.11 standard allows APs to ignore probe requests for
        security reasons.

        D. =It is common for stations to continue to send probe
        requests after being associated to an AP.=

        *答案解析*

        A and D. There are two types of scanning: passive, which
        occurs when a station listens to the beacons to discover an
        AP, and active, which occurs when a station sends probe
        requests looking for APs. Stations send probe requests only if
        they are performing an active scan. After a station is
        associated, it is common for the station to continue to learn
        about nearby APs. All client stations maintain a “known AP”
        list that is constantly updated by active scanning.

    14. Given that an 802.11 MAC header can have as many as four MAC
        addresses, which type of addresses are not found in an 802.3
        MAC header? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. SA

        B. =BSSID=

        C. DA

        D. =RA=

        E. =TA=

        *答案解析*

        B, D and E. Although there are similarities, the addressing
        used by 802.11 MAC frames is much more complex than Ethernet
        frames. 802.3 frames have only a source address (SA) and
        destination address (DA) in the layer 2 header. The four MAC
        addresses used by an 802.11 frame can be used as five
        different types of addresses: receiver address (RA),
        transmitter address (TA), basic service set identifier
        (BSSID), destination address (DA), and source address (SA).

    15. When a client station is first powered on, what is the order
        of frames generated by the client station and AP?

        A. Probe request/probe response, association request/response,
        authentication request/response

        B. =Probe request/probe response, authentication
        request/response, association request/response=

        C. Association request/response, authentication
        request/response, probe request/probe response

        D. Authentication request/response, association
        request/response, probe request/probe response

        *答案解析*

        B. When the client first attempts to connect to an AP, it will
        first send a probe request and listen for a probe
        response. After it receives a probe response, it will attempt
        to authenticate to the AP and then associate to the network.

    16. WLAN users have recently complained about gaps in audio and
        problems with the pushto-talk capabilities with the ACME
        Company’s VoWiFi phones. What could be the cause of this
        problem? 

        A. Misconfigured TIM setting

        B. =Misconfigured DTIM setting=

        C. Misconfigured ATIM setting

        D. Misconfigured BTIM setting

        *答案解析*

        B. The delivery traffic indication message (DTIM) is used to
        ensure that all stations using power management are awake when
        multicast or broadcast traffic is sent. The DTIM interval is
        important for any application that uses multicasting. For
        example, many VoWiFi vendors support push-to-talk capabilities
        that send VoIP traffic to a multicast address. A misconfigured
        DTIM interval would cause performance issues during a
        push-to-talk multicast. 

    17. The WLAN help desk gets a call that all of the sudden, all of
        the HR-DSSS (802.11b) VoWiFi phones cannot connect to any of
        the ERP (802.11g) lightweight APs that are managed by a
        multiple-channel architecture WLAN controller. All the laptops
        with ERP (802.11g) radios can still connect. What are the
        possible causes of this problem? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. =The WLAN admin disabled the 1, 2, 5.5, and 11 Mbps data
        rates on the controller.=

        B. The WLAN admin disabled the 6 and 9 Mbps data rates on the
        controller.

        C. =The WLAN admin enabled the 6 and 9 Mbps data rates on the controller as basic rates.=

        D. The WLAN admin configured all the APs on channel 6.

        *答案解析*

        A and C. An ERP (802.11g) AP is backward compatible with
        HR-DSSS and supports the data rates of 1, 2, 5.5, and 11 Mbps
        as well as the ERP-OFDM data rates of 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36,
        48, and 54 Mbps. If a WLAN admin disabled the 1, 2, 5.5, and
        11 Mbps data rates, backward compatibility will effectively be
        disabled and the HR-DSSS clients will not be able to
        connect. The 802.11-2012 standard defines the use of basic
        rates, which are required rates. If a client station does not
        support any of the basic rates used by an AP, the client
        station will be denied association to the BSS. If a WLAN admin
        configured the ERP-OFDM data rates of 6 and 9 Mbps as basic
        rates, the HR-DSSS clients would be denied association because
        they do not support those rates. 

    18. In a multiple-channel architecture, roaming is controlled by
        the client station and occurs based on a set of proprietary
        rules determined by the manufacturer of the wireless
        radio. Which of the following parameters are often used when
        making the decision to roam? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. =Received signal level=

        B. Distance

        C. =SNR=

        D. WMM access categories

        *答案解析*

        A and C. The amplitude of the received signals from the APs is
        usually the main variable when clients make a roaming
        decision. Client roaming mechanisms are often based on RSSI
        values, including received signal levels and signal-to-noise
        ratio (SNR). Distance and WMM access categories have nothing
        to do with the client’s decision to roam to a new AP.
        
    19. What are some of the advantages of using U-APSD and WMM-PS
        power management over legacy power-management methods? (Choose
        all that apply.)

        A. =Applications control doze time and trigger frames.=

        B. U-APSD APs transmit all voice and video data immediately.

        C. =The client does not have to wait for a beacon to request data.=

        D. =Downlink traffic is sent in a frame burst.=

        E. =Data frames are used as trigger frames. PS-Poll frames are not used.=

        *答案解析*

        A, C, D and E. Applications now control the power-save
        management behavior by setting doze periods and sending
        trigger frames. Clients using time-sensitive applications will
        send triggers to the AP frequently, while clients using more
        latency-tolerant applications will have a longer doze
        period. The trigger and delivery method eliminates the need
        for PS-Poll frames. The client can request to download
        buffered traffic and does not have to wait for a beacon
        frame. All the downlink application traffic is sent in a
        faster frame burst during the AP’s TXOP. 

    20. WMM-PS is based on which 802.11-2012 power-management method?

        A. S-APSD

        B. =U-APSD=

        C. PSMP

        D. SM Power Save

        E. PS-Poll

        *答案解析*

        B. The IEEE 802.11-2007 standard defines an enhanced
        power-management method called automatic power save delivery
        (APSD). The two APSD methods that are defined are scheduled
        automatic power save delivery (S-APSD) and unscheduled
        automatic power save delivery (U-APSD). The Wi-Fi Alliance’s
        WMM Power Save (WMM-PS) certification is based on U-APSD.

*** Management, control and data planes
      Telecommunication networks are often defined as three logical
      planes of operation:
      - *Management Plane* The /management/ plane is defined by
        administrative network management, administration, and
        monitoring.
      - *Control Plane* The /control plane/ consists of control or
        signaling information and is often defined as network
        intelligence or protocols.
      - *Data Plane* The /data plane/, also known as the user plane, is
        the location in a network where user traffic is actually
        forwarded. 

** WLAN architecture

    In most cases, the main purpose of 802.11 technologies is to
    provide a wireless portal into a wired infrastructure network. 

*** Autonomous WLAN architecture
      /autonomous AP/ are often referred to as fat APs: a standalone
      WLAN portal device where all three planes of operation existed
      and operated on the edge of the network architecture.
      An autonomous access point typically encompasses both the 802.11
      protocol stack and the 802.3 protocol stack.
*** Centralized network management systems
      In the centralized WLAN architecture, autonomous APs have been
      replaced with /controller-based access points/, also known as
      lightweight APs or thin APs.
**** WLAN Controller
      At the heart of the centralized WLAN architecture model is the
      WLAN controller
      
*** Cloud networking
    
      1. Cloud-Enabled Networking
         the management plane resides in the cloud, but data plane
         mechanisms such as switching and routing remain on the local
         network and usually in hardware.
      2. Cloud-Based Networking
         the data plane is also moved to the cloud with the intent of
         eliminating hardware other than that used to access the
         Internet at the local network. 

*** Centralized WLAN architecture

         This model uses a central WLAN controller that resides in the
         core of the network.
    
         all planes were moved out of access points and into a WLAN
         controller: 

         *Management Plane*

         Access points are configured and managed from the WLAN
         controller using a subset of NMS capabilities.

         *Control Plane*

         Dynamic RF, load balancing, roaming handoffs, and other
         mechanisms exist in the WLAN controller.

         *Data Plane*

         The WLAN controller exists as a data distribution point for
         user traffi c. Access points tunnel all user traffi c to a central controller.

* 第十二章 WLAN 问题处理与设计 
  A bottoms-up approach to analyzing the OSI reference model layers
  also applies to wireless networking. A wireless networking
  administrator should always try to first determine whether problems
  exist at layer 1 and layer 2.

  许多无线网络问题发生在Layer 1，即物理层，如无电力供应的AP或是CLIENT
  Radio驱动问题，通常会引起连接性问题或是性能问题。频谱分析仪通常是诊
  断Layer 1 RF干涉问题的有用工具。

  排除Layer 1是问题产生的根源后，WLAN管理员需要尝试确认问题是否发生在
  数据链路层。Authentication和Association问题通常发生，是由于AP或其他
  相关软件没有配置合适的安全设定。

** Layer 2重传
   在WLAN网络中， Layer 2重传的情况往往会引起性能方面的问题。过多的
   Layer 2重传会从如下两个方面影响WLAN：
   1. 重传会增加开销从而降低吞吐量。
   2. 重传过多会导致音视频不同步以及跳变产生，导致VoIP等实时性的应用体
      验变差。
   一般的应用能够忍受10%的重传率，但是对于VoWiFi网络，重传率不能超过5%。 
   导致Layer 2重传的原因是多方面的：
   1. Multipath
   2. RF干涉
   3. 低SNR。
   4. 隐藏结点
   5. near/far问题
   6. 功率匹配
   7. 相邻信道干涉

** RF干涉
   有多种不同类型的干涉会极大地影响802.11无线网络的性能。干涉的设备会
   阻止一个802.11 radio传输数据，导致DOS。 如果另一个RF源以很强的功率
   传输数据，则802.11 radio会在CCA(clear channel assessment)阶段侦测到
   RF能量，并延迟传输。另一种干涉会导致传输的数据帧直接被破坏。过多的
   重传会极大地降低吞吐量。有如下几种干扰：
   
*** 窄波干涉
    窄波通常只占用小部分频宽，不会对整个频段造成DoS，比如2.4GHz
    ISM频段。窄波信号通常振幅很高，会完全中断频率空间范围内的数据传输。
    窄波信号会中断一个或多个802.11信道。 解决之道就是用频谱分析仪定位
    干涉的信道，并采用措施避开这些被干涉的信道。

*** 宽波干涉
    如果传输的信号会中断整个频段的通信，则认为是宽波干涉。宽波干涉会导
    致整个2.4GHz的ISM频段出现DoS。唯一的解决办法是通过频谱分析仪定位
    干涉的设备，并将其移开。 

*** 全波段干涉
    这种情况一般发生在FHSS（Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum）通信中。
    FHSS设备不停地在整个频段跳跃，会影响在这个频段范围内传输数据的所有设
    备。 蓝牙设备是一种FHSS类型的设备， 会在整个2.4GHz ISM范围内进行跳
    变，会影响附近工作在2.4GHz的设备。解决的办法也只能是通过频谱分析仪
    定位干涉的设备，并将其移开。

*** Adjacent Channel Interference
    the 802.11-2012 standard requires 25 MHz of separation between the
    center frequencies of 802.11b/g channels in order for them to be
    considered nonoverlapping.

    When designing a wireless LAN, you need overlapping coverage cells
    in order to provide for roaming. However, the overlapping cells
    should not have overlapping frequencies, Overlapping coverage
    cells with overlapping frequencies cause what is known as adjacent
    channel interference. 

*** Low SNR
    背景干扰信号强度接近接收的信号，或者接收到的信号强度太低。SNR不是
    一个比率，而是接收到的信号与背景干扰信号之间的分贝差值（decibels）。
    如果一个802.11设备接收到一个-70dBm的信号，此时背景干扰信号强度为-95dBm，
    则SNR为25 dB。

    通常SNR在25以上，则认为信号质量好，而低于10则认为信号质量很差。 

*** 功率设置不匹配
    AP的功率与STA的功率设置不匹配，导致出现这种情况：AP发出的数据，STA
    能收到，但是STA回的ACK，AP却收不到。 

*** Near/Far
    离AP较近且功率较大的设备会影响离AP较远，且功能偏低的设备与AP之间
    的数据通信。 

*** 隐藏结点问题
    连接到同一个AP中的两个设备不能相互侦测到对方的存在，导致数据传输过
    程中产生冲突，也会导致Layer 2重传。

    通常的一个解决方案是：AP禁掉2.4GHz下的1， 2M数据传输率。 原因有二：
    1. 容量
    2. 1，2M数据传输率覆盖范围大，容易造成隐藏结点的问题。

    解决隐藏结点有如下方法：
    1. 使用RTS/CTS来侦测是否存在隐藏结点的问题，也可作为解决隐藏结点问
       题的临时方案。
    2. 所有STA的功率增加， 这个方法可行，但不推荐，会增加co-channel干
       扰。
    3. 移除障碍
    4. 移动隐藏结点，使他们更接近。
    5. 增加另一个AP。

** 802.11覆盖范围的考量
   
*** 动态速率调整
    低速率的设备，会影响处于同一个BSS中的高速率设备的吞吐量。

*** Roaming
    Rooming问题的产生通常是由于差劲的网络设计或者是WiFi设备驱动的问题。
    Rooming的决定一般跟WiFi芯片厂商有关，每个厂家的行为都可能是特有的，
    但一般会根据如下一些条件决定是否进行Roaming：
    1. RSSI
    2. Noise Level
    3. bit-error rate
    4. 重传率

*** =Co-channel= Interference
    The unnecessary medium contention overhead that occurs because all
    the APs are on the same channel is called co-channel interference
    (CCI).

** Performance
   
     如下一些因素会影响一个WLAN的覆盖范围：

       传输功率
     - Antenna Gain
       天线增益
     - Antenna Type
       天线类型
     - 波长
       高频率的信号，波长短，衰减快。
     - Free Space Path Loss
       随着距离的增加，信号强度会成培衰减。
     - Physical Environment
       Wifi设备所处的物理环境，如墙壁等。

     如下一些因素会影响一个WLAN的吞吐量：
     - Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance
       (CSMA/CA)
       不同的帧间间隔，物理载波侦测，虚拟载波侦测等等会产生开销并消耗
       带宽。
     - Encryption
       各种加密算法也会产生开销。
     - Application Use
       不同的应用对带宽的消耗有区别。
     - Number of Clients
       同时在线的客户端数量也会影响网络整体的吞吐量。
     - Layer 2 Retransmissions
       数据重传也是影响吞吐量的一个重要因素。

** Review Questions
    
    1. What are some recommended best practices when deploying a
       high-density WLAN? (Choose all that apply.)

       A. Deploying unidirectional MIMO patch antennas

       B. Band steering of all clients to 5 GHz

       C. Load balancing

       D. Low AP transmit power

       E. Layer 3 roaming

       *答案解析*

       A, C and D. Unidirectional MIMO patch antennas can be mounted
       in the ceiling to provide sectorized coverage in a high-density
       WLAN. Load balancing clients between multiple APs will help
       with capacity. Lowering the AP transmit power effectively
       reduces the cell size and minimizes co-channel
       interference. Band steering can be useful if used to balance
       the clients between both the 2.4 and 5 GHz radios. Steering all
       the clients only to 5 GHz is not necessarily ideal in a
       high-density environment. Layer 3 roaming is not part of high
       client capacity design. 

    2. If the access points transmit on the same frequency channel in
       an MCA(Multi-Channel Architecture) architecture, what type of interference is caused by
       overlapping coverage cells? 

       A. Intersymbol interference

       B. Adjacent channel interference

       C. All-band interference

       D. Narrowband interference

       E. Co-channel interference

       *答案解析*

       E. In an MCA architecture, if all the access points are
       mistakenly configured on the same channel, unnecessary medium
       contention overhead is the result. If an AP is transmitting,
       all nearby access points and clients on the same channel will
       defer transmissions. The result is that throughput is adversely
       affected. Nearby APs and clients have to wait much longer to
       transmit because they have to take their turn. The unnecessary
       medium contention overhead that occurs because all the APs are
       on the same channel is called co-channel interference (CCI). In
       reality, the 802.11 radios are operating exactly as defined by
       the CSMA/CA mechanisms, and this behavior should really be
       called co-channel cooperation. 

    3. What variables might affect range in an 802.11 WLAN? (Choose
       all that apply.)

       A. Transmission power

       B. CSMA/CA

       C. Encryption

       D. Antenna gain

       E. Physical environment

       *答案解析*

       A, D and E. The original transmission amplitude will have an
       impact on the range of an RF cell. Antennas amplify signal
       strength and can increase range. Walls and other obstacles will
       attenuate an RF signal and affect range. CSMA/CA and encryption
       do not affect range but do affect throughput. 

    4. What can be done to fix the hidden node problem? (Choose all
       that apply.)

       A. Increase the power on the access point.

       B. Move the hidden node station.

       C. Increase power on all client stations.

       D. Remove the obstacle.

       E. Decrease power on the hidden node station.

       *答案解析*

       B, C and D. The hidden node problem arises when client stations
       cannot hear the RF transmissions of another client
       station. Increasing the transmission power of client stations
       will increase the transmission range of each station, resulting
       in increased likelihood of all the stations hearing each
       other. Increasing client power is not a recommended fix because
       best practice dictates that client stations use the same
       transmit power used by all other radios in the BSS, including
       the AP. Moving the hidden node station within transmission
       range of the other stations also results in stations hearing
       each other. Removing an obstacle that prevents stations from
       hearing each other also fixes the problem. The best fix to the
       hidden node problem is to add another access point in the area
       that the hidden node resides. 

    5. Layer 2 retransmissions occur when frames become
       corrupted. What are some of the causes of layer 2 retries?
       (Choose all that apply.) 

       A. High SNR
       
       B. Low SNR

       C. Co-channel interference

       D. RF interference

       E. Adjacent channel interference

       *答案解析*

       B, D and E. If any portion of a unicast frame is corrupted, the
       cyclic redundancy check (CRC) will fail and the receiving
       802.11 radio will not return an ACK frame to the transmitting
       802.11 radio. If an ACK frame is not received by the original
       transmitting radio, the unicast frame is not acknowledged and
       will have to be retransmitted. RF interference, low SNR, hidden
       nodes, mismatched power settings, near/far problems, and
       adjacent channel interference may all cause layer 2
       retransmissions. Co-channel interference does not cause retries
       but does add unnecessary medium contention overhead.

    6. What scenarios might result in a hidden node problem? (Choose
       all that apply.)

       A. Distributed antenna system

       B. Coverage cells that are too large

       C. Coverage cells that are too small

       D. Physical obstruction

       E. Co-channel interference

       *答案解析*

       A, B and D. The hidden node problem arises when client stations
       cannot hear the RF transmissions of another client
       station. Distributed antenna systems with multiple antenna
       elements are notorious for causing the hidden node
       problem. When coverage cells are too large as a result of the
       access point’s radio transmitting at too much power, client
       stations at opposite ends of an RF coverage cell often cannot
       hear each other. Obstructions such as a newly constructed wall
       can also result in stations not hearing each other.

    7. What are some of the negative effects of layer 2
       retransmissions? (Choose all that apply.)

       A. Decreased range

       B. Excessive MAC sublayer overhead

       C. Decreased latency

       D. Increased latency

       E. Jitter

       *答案解析*

       B, D and E. Excessive layer 2 retransmissions adversely affect
       the WLAN in two ways. First, layer 2 retransmissions increase
       MAC overhead and therefore decrease throughput. Second, if
       application data has to be retransmitted at layer 2, the timely
       delivery of application traffic becomes delayed or
       inconsistent. Applications such as VoIP depend on the timely
       and consistent delivery of the IP packet. Excessive layer 2
       retransmissions usually result in increased latency and jitter
       problems for time-sensitive applications such as voice and
       video. 

    8. Several users are complaining that their VoWiFi phones keep
       losing connectivity. The WLAN administrator notices that the
       frame transmissions of the VoWiFi phones are corrupted when
       listened to with a protocol analyzer near the access point but
       are not corrupted when listened to with the protocol analyzer
       near the VoWiFi phone. What is the most likely cause of this
       problem? 

       A. RF interference

       B. Multipath

       C. Hidden node

       D. Adjacent channel interference

       E. Mismatched power settings

       *答案解析*

       E. An often overlooked cause of layer 2 retransmissions is
       mismatched transmit power settings between an access point and
       a client radio. Communications can break down if a client
       station’s transmit power level is less than the transmit power
       level of the access point. As a client moves to the outer edges
       of the coverage cell, the client can “hear” the AP; however,
       the AP cannot “hear” the client. If the client station’s
       frames are corrupted near the AP but not near the client, the
       most likely cause is mismatched power settings.

    9. A single user is complaining that her VoWiFi phone has choppy
       audio. The WLAN administrator notices that the user’s MAC
       address has a retry rate of 25 percent when observed with a
       protocol analyzer. However, all the other users have a retry
       rate of about 5 percent when also observed with the protocol
       analyzer. What is the most likely cause of this problem?

       A. Near/far

       B. Multipath

       C. Co-channel interference

       D. Hidden node

       E. Low SNR

       *答案解析*

       D. If an end user complains of a degradation of throughput, one
       possible cause is a hidden node. A protocol analyzer is a
       useful tool in determining hidden node issues. If the protocol
       analyzer indicates a higher retransmission rate for the MAC
       address of one station when compared to the other client
       stations, chances are a hidden node has been found. Some
       protocol analyzers even have hidden node alarms based on
       retransmission thresholds.

    10. What type of interference is caused by overlapping coverage
        cells with overlapping frequencies?

        A. Intersymbol interference

        B. Adjacent channel interference

        C. All-band interference

        D. Narrowband interference

        E. Co-channel interference

        *答案解析*

        B. Overlapping coverage cells with overlapping frequencies
        cause adjacent channel interference, which causes a severe
        degradation in latency, jitter, and throughput. If overlapping
        coverage cells also have frequency overlap, frames will become
        corrupt, retransmissions will increase, and performance will
        suffer significantly. 

    11. Based on RSSI metrics, concentric zones of variable data rate
        coverage exist around an access point due to the upshifting
        and downshifting of client stations between data rates. What
        is the correct name of this process, according to the IEEE
        802.11-2012 standard? 

        A. Dynamic rate shifting

        B. Dynamic rate switching

        C. Automatic rate selection

        D. Adaptive rate selection

        E. All of the above

        *答案解析*

        B. As client station radios move away from an access point,
        they will shift down to lower bandwidth capabilities by using
        a process known as dynamic rate switching (DRS). The objective
        of DRS is upshifting and downshifting for rate optimization
        and improved performance. Although dynamic rate switching is
        the proper name for this process, all these terms refer to the
        method of speed fallback that a wireless LAN client uses as
        distance increases from the access point. 

    12. Which of these weather conditions is a concern when deploying
        a long-distance point-topoint bridge link?

        A. Wind

        B. Rain

        C. Fog

        D. Changes in air temperature

        E. All of the above

        *答案解析*

        E. Highly directional antennas are susceptible to what is
        known as antenna wind loading, which is antenna movement or
        shifting caused by wind. Grid antennas may be needed to
        alleviate the problem. Rain and fog can attenuate an RF
        signal; therefore, a system operating margin (also known as
        fade margin) of 20 dB is necessary. A change in air
        temperature is also known as air stratification, which causes
        refraction. K-factor calculations may also be necessary to
        compensate for refraction. 

    13. What variables might affect range in an 802.11 WLAN?

        A. Wavelength

        B. Free space path loss

        C. Brick walls

        D. Trees

        E. All of the above

        *答案解析*

        E. Higher frequency signals have a smaller wavelength property
        and will attenuate faster than a lower frequency signal with a
        larger wavelength. Higher frequency signals therefore will
        have shorter range. In any RF environment, free space path
        loss (FSPL) attenuates the signal as a function of
        distance. Loss in signal strength affects range. Brick walls
        exist in an indoor physical environment, while trees exist in
        an outdoor physical environment. Both will attenuate an RF
        signal, thereby affecting range. 

    14. Given: Wi-Fi clients can roam seamlessly at layer 2 if all the
        APs are configured with the same SSID and same security
        settings. However, if clients cross layer 3 boundaries, a
        layer 3 roaming solution will be needed. Which device
        functions as the home agent if a Mobile IP solution has been
        implemented in an enterprise WLAN environment where no WLAN
        controller is deployed?

        A. Wireless network management server (WNMS)

        B. Access layer switch

        C. Layer 3 switch

        D. Access point on the original subnet

        E. Access point on the new subnet

        *答案解析*

        D. A mobile client receives an IP address also known as a home
        address on the original subnet. The mobile client must
        register its home address with a device called a home agent
        (HA). The original access point on the client’s home network
        serves as the home agent. The home agent is a single point of
        contact for a client when it roams across layer 3
        boundaries. Any traffic that is sent to the client’s home
        address is intercepted by the home agent access point and sent
        through a Mobile IP tunnel to the foreign agent AP on the new
        subnet. The client is therefore able to retain its original IP
        address when roaming across layer 3 boundaries. 

    15. Which of the following can cause roaming problems? (Choose all
        that apply.)

        A. Too little cell coverage overlap

        B. Too much cell coverage overlap

        C. Free space path loss

        D. CSMA/CA

        E. Hidden node

        *答案解析*

        A and B. Although overlap cell coverage is a fallacy, cell
        overlap is often used to refer to the duplicate cell coverage
        heard from a client perspective. Roaming problems will occur
        if there is not enough overlap in cell coverage. Too little
        overlap will effectively create a roaming dead zone, and
        connectivity may even temporarily be lost. If two RF cells
        have too much overlap, a station may stay associated with its
        original AP and not connect to a second access point even
        though the station is directly underneath the second access point.

    16. What are some problems that can occur when an access point is
        transmitting at full power? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. Hidden node

        B. Co-channel interference

        C. Mismatched power between the AP and the clients

        D. Intersymbol interference

        *答案解析*

        A, B and C. A mistake often made when deploying access points
        is to have the APs transmitting at full power. Effectively,
        this extends the range of the access point but causes many
        problems that have been discussed throughout this
        chapter. Oversized coverage usually will not meet your
        capacity needs. Oversized coverage cells can cause hidden node
        problems. Access points at full power may not be able to hear
        the transmissions of client stations with lower transmit
        power. Access points at full power will most likely also
        increase the odds of co-channel interference due to bleed-over
        transmissions. If the access point’s coverage and range is a
        concern, the best method of extending range is to increase the
        AP’s antenna gain instead of increasing transmit power.

    17. Why would a WLAN network administrator consider disabling the
        two lowest rates on an 802.11b/g/n access point? (Choose all
        that apply.)

        A. Medium contention

        B. Adjacent channel interference

        C. Hidden node

        D. Intersymbol interference

        E. All of the above

        *答案解析*

        A and C. Medium contention, also known as CSMA/CA, requires
        that all radios access the medium in a pseudorandom
        fashion. Radios transmitting at slower data rates will occupy
        the medium much longer, while faster radios have to wait. Data
        rates of 1 and 2 Mbps can create very large coverage cells,
        which may prevent a hidden node station at one edge of the
        cell from being heard by other client stations at the opposite
        side of the coverage cell. 

    18. Which type of interference is caused by destructive multipath?

        A. Intersymbol interference

        B. All-band interference

        C. Narrowband interference

        D. Wideband interference

        E. Physical interference

        *答案解析*

        A. Multipath can cause intersymbol interference (ISI), which
        causes data corruption. Because of the difference in time
        between the primary signal and the reflected signals, known as
        the delay spread, the receiver can have problems demodulating
        the RF signal’s information. The delay spread time
        differential results in corrupted data and therefore layer 2
        retransmissions. 

    19. In a multiple-channel architecture (MCA) design, what is the
        greatest number of nonoverlapping channels that can be
        deployed in the 2.4 GHz ISM band? 

        A. 3

        B. 12

        C. 11

        D. 14

        E. 4

        *答案解析*

        A. HR-DSSS (802.11b) and ERP (802.11g) channels require 25 MHz
        of separation between the center frequencies to be considered
        nonoverlapping. The three channels of 1, 6, and 11 meet these
        requirements in the United States. In other countries,
        threechannel plans such as 2, 7, and 12; 3, 8, and 13; and 4,
        9, and 14 would work as well. Traditionally, 1, 6, and 11 are
        chosen almost universally. 

    20. What factors should be taken into consideration when designing
        a channel reuse plan for 5 GHz access points? (Choose all that
        apply.) 

        A. Regulatory channels permitted

        B. Number of VLANs permitted

        C. Encryption

        D. DFS support for the clients

        E. DFS support for the APs

        *答案解析*

        A, D and E. Several factors should be considered when planning
        a 5 GHz channel reuse pattern. One factor is what channels are
        available legally in your country or region. Another factor to
        consider is what channels the client population
        supports. Wi-Fi radios must be certified to transmit in the
        dynamic frequency selection (DFS) channels to avoid
        interference with radar. A high likelihood exists that the
        client population may not be certified for dynamic frequency
        selection (DFS) channels in the UNII-2 and UNII-2e
        bands. Additionally, many 5 GHz access points might also not
        be certified to transmit in the DFS channels. 

* 第十三章 802.11网络安全架构
** 802.11 security basics
     802.11无线网络安全主要包含如下5个要素：
     1. Data privacy and integrity
     2. Authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA)
     3. Segmentation
     4. Monitoring
     5. Policy

*** Data privacy and integrity

      基于WLAN网络的开放性特点，为了保护数据私密性，必须对数据进行加密。
      主要有加密方式：
      1. WEP
         使用RC算法
      2. TKIP
         使用RC算法
      3. CCMP
         使用AES算法

*** Authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA)

      - =Authentication（认证）=
        对身份和私密信息进行验证，如用户名和密码信息。
      - =Authorization（授权）=
        决定设备或用户是否有权访问网络资源。必须在认证完成后。
      - =Accounting=
        对用户或设备使用网络资源的行为进行跟踪记录。

*** Segmentation
    
      对已经授权访问网络资源的用户再次进行一个分组，便于为不同的用户或
      设备提供不同安全等级的网络服务。

*** Monitoring and policy

      监测网络攻击。
      
** Legacy 802.11 security

*** Legacy authentication

      最初802.11定义了两种认证方法：
      1. 开放系统认证
      2. 共享密钥认证

      802.11中提到的 =认证= ，不是通常认为的对连接到网络上的用户的身份
      进行验证，更多的是指对能力的认证，即验证双方都是合法的802.11设备。

**** Open System authentication

       1. The client sends an authentication request.
       2. The access point then sends an authentication response.

**** Shared Key authentication

       1. The client station sent an authentication request to the access point.
       2. The access point sent a cleartext challenge to the client
          station in an authentication response.
       3. The client station encrypted the cleartext challenge and
          sent it back to the access point in the body of another
          authentication request frame.
       4. The access point decrypted the station’s response and
          compared it to the challenge text:
          - If they matched, the access point would respond by sending
            a fourth and final authentication frame to the station
            confirming the success.
          - If they did not match, the access point would respond
            negatively. If the access point could not decrypt the
            challenge, it would also respond negatively.

       Shared Key认证过程看起来比Open system认证过程要安全些，但是实际
       上，一旦截获认证过程中加密明文的Shared Key，则之后所有的数据帧
       都会被解密。所有Shared Key认证方式已经被废除，不建议使用了。目
       前，最新的标准建议使用更安全的认证方法： =802.1X/EAP= 。

*** Static WEP encryption

      有线等效加密是Layer-2层的加密方法，使用RC4作为流加密器。最初的
      802.11标准只定义了64-位的WEP作为可支持的加密方法，之后，128-位的
      WEP也被定义为一种可支持的加密方法。WEP的三个目标如下：
      1. Confidentiality（机密性）
         在数据传输前，进行加密。
      2. Access Control（访问控制）
         STA必须与AP拥有相同 的WEP Key。
      3. Data Integrity（数据完整性）
         在加密前，会对数据计算一个ICV（integrity check value）值，以
         防止数据被修改。

      64-位的WEP使用一个40-位的静态密钥，再加上 一个由驱动选择的24-位
      的数字组成。 该24-位的数字，称为 /initialization vector (IV)/ 。
      是明文发送的，并且每帧发送时，这个IV值不一样。 不过，这个IV值的
      空间只有6,777,216个不同的值，所以会出现重复使用IV这个值的情况。
      128-位WEP加密使用104-位静态密钥加上一个24-位的IV。

      [[./images/2015/2015121002.png]]

      1. WEP runs a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) on the plaintext
         data that is to be encrypted and then appends the integrity
         check value (ICV) to the end of the plaintext data.
      2. A 24-bit cleartext initialization vector (IV) is then
         generated and combined with the static secret key.
      3. WEP then uses both the static key and the IV as seeding
         material through a pseudorandom algorithm that generates
         random bits of data known as a keystream. 
         These pseudorandom bits are equal in length to the plaintext
         data that is to be encrypted.
      4. The pseudorandom bits in the keystream are then combined with
         the plaintext data bits by using a Boolean XOR process.
         The end result is the WEP ciphertext, which is the encrypted
         data.
      5. The encrypted data is then prefixed with the cleartext IV.

*** MAC filters
    
      由于MAC地址的唯一性特点，可以通过MAC地址过滤来限制设备是否允许关
      联当前AP等等，具体过滤规则802.11规范中并没有说明，与具体厂商实现
      有关。

*** SSID cloaking(隐藏SSID)

      当AP设置了禁止广播SSID后，它发出的Beacon帧中SSID字段就是空的，这
      样，STA不能通过被动扫描的方式发现设备。主设备进行主动扫描，即使
      发出一个Null Probe Request，AP虽然会回一个Probe Response，但是它
      的SSID值是空的，有些厂商设计的行为可以是直接丢弃这种Null probe
      request请求。当然，对于定向的Probe Request，如果SSID指定为当前的
      AP设置的SSID，则会被允许进行Association操作。

      不过，Layer-2层的抓包工具，是可以通过抓包发现AP的隐藏SSID，因为SSID是明
      文的。

** Robust security

     802.11i定义了两种认证方法：
     1. 802.1X/EAP authentication
        通常用于企业环境
     2. Preshared Key（PSK） or a passphrase.
        通常用于家庭环境或小型办公环境

     CCMP/AES是默认的加密方法，TKIP/RC4是可选的加密方法。

     #+CAPTION: Security standards and certifications comparison
     [[./images/2015/2015121003.png]]
        
*** Robust security network (RSN)

      802.11标准定义了：
      1. RSN（robust security network）
      2. RSNA（robust security network associations）

      两个STA必须相互认证并关联，同时通过4-Way握手过程创建动态加密密钥。
      两个STA之间的关联过程称之为RSNA。

      RSN网络只允许创建RSNA。一个网络是否为RSN网络可以从 /RSN
      Information Element (IE)./ 域得知，该信息一般携带于Beacon、Probe
      Response、Association Request、Reassociation Request帧中。通过这
      个信息可以得知每个STA加密套件的能力。

      Pre-RSN和RSN机制可以同时存在于一个BSS中。

      A transition security network (TSN) supports RSN-defined
      security, as well as legacy security such as WEP, within the
      same BSS, although most vendors do not support a TSN.

*** Authentication and authorization

      Authentication：the verification of user identity and　
      credentials.
      Authorization involves whether a device or user is granted
      access to network resources and services.

      在进行Authorization之前，必须通过了Authentication。　
    
*** PSK authentication

      最新的802.11标准定义了认证和密钥管理服务（AKM）. AKM服务同时要求
      认证过程和加密密钥的产生和管理。

      AKMP（authentication and key management protocol (AKMP)）在
      802.1X中可以是 PSK也可以是EAP协议。

      WPA/WPA2-Personal使用PSK认证，而WPA/WPA2-Enterprise使用
      802.1X/EAP认证方案。

      WPA/WPA2-Personal可以让终端用户输入一个ASCII字符串，作为密码，大
      小从8到63个字符大小。实际上，在技术背后，存在一个密码映射到PSK这
      样的一个过程。

      Wi-Fi联盟称呼PSK认证的标准名称为：WPA-Personal or WPA2-Personal。
      不过，不同厂商还有其他的一些称呼：WPA/WPA2-Passphrase,
      WPA/WPA2-PSK, and WPA/WPA2-Preshared Key.

*** Proprietary PSK authentication

       专有的PSK认证是由厂家自己定义的方法，以应对字典攻击。标准的PSK
       认证方法中，所有的设备拥有相同的PSK，而厂家特有的方法可以允许每
       个设备拥有唯一的PSK。

       #+CAPTION: Proprietary PSK
       [[./images/2015/2015121004.png]]
     
*** 802.1X/EAP framework

      802.11X标准是一种基于端口访问控制的标准。在执行认证过程时，需要
      一套协议，EAP就是用于用户认证的协议，它是Layer-2层的认证协议。

      802.1X/EAP solution requires that both the supplicant and the
      authentication server support the same type of EAP. The
      authenticator must be configured for 802.1X/EAP authentication
      but does not care which EAP type passes through. The
      authenticator and the supplicant must support the same type of
      encryption.

      #+CAPTION: 802.1X/EAP authentication
      [[./images/2015/2015121005.png]]

*** Dynamic encryption-key generation

      尽管802.1X/EAP框架没有要求加密，但是建议进行加密。802.1X/EAP的目
      的是认证和授权，它的一个副产物就是动态加密密钥的产生和分发。 

*** 4-Way Handshake

      对于两个RSN设备，相互之间在建立认证和关联过程的同时，也需要通过
      一个4-Way握手过程来产生一个动态加密密钥。

      RSNA使用了一个动态密钥管理方法，用来创建5个单独的密钥。 其中，包
      含GMK(Group Master Key)和PMK(Pairwise Master Key)密钥的创建。PMK
      是从802.1X/EAP认证过程中产生的，也可以在PSK认证过程中产生。这些
      Master key做为最终密钥产生时所需要的Seeding Material。 最终的加
      密密钥称为PTK（Pairwise Transient Key）和GTK（Group Temporal
      Key）。PTK用来加密和解密单播数据，GTK用来加密和解密广播和多播数
      据。

      不管使用PSK或是802.1X/EAP，4-Way握手过程一定会发生，并且，当STA
      从一个BSS漫游到另一个BSS时，新的4-Way握手过程会产生，以生成新的
      加密和解密密钥。

*** WPA/WPA2-Personal

      当使用PSK认证时，有一个公式用来将passphase(用户输入的密码或AP设
      置的密码)转换成PMK， 用于在4-Way握手过程中产生动态加密解密密钥。

*** TKIP encryption

      对WEP加密方法的一个改良，仍然使用RC4算法，

      802.11n设备不允许使用WEP加密方法，当启用HT或VHT时，也允许使用
      TKIP加密方法。

*** CCMP encryption

      最新的加密方法，802.11n之后的设备默认使用该加密方法。

** Traffic segmentation
   
*** VLANs

      Virtual local area networks (VLANs) are used to create separate
      broadcast domains in a layer 2 network and are often used to
      restrict access to network resources without regard to physical
      topology of the network.

      a WLAN environment, individual SSIDs can be mapped to individual
      VLANs, and users can be segmented by the SSID/VLAN pair, all
      while communicating through a single access point.

      #+CAPTION: Wireless VLANs
      [[./images/2015/2015121006.png]]

*** RBAC

      Role-based access control (RBAC) is another approach to
      restricting system access to authorized users.

** Infrastructure security

        protect hardware and interface.

*** Physical security

        防止偷盗
       
*** Interface security

        通过一个安全的SSID，连接上AP，然后使用命令行界面对AP进行紧急处
        理。

** VPN wireless security

      Use of VPN technology is mandatory for remote access.

*** Layer 3 VPNs

       The most commonly used layer 3 VPN technology is Internet
       Protocol Security (IPsec).

*** SSL VPN

       SSL VPN is another VPN technology that operate at other layer
       such as SSL tunneling.

*** VPN deployment

*** Guest WLAN security
      
       提供访客通过WLAN访问网络的安全。

*** Captive portal

        Most hotspots and guest networks are secured by a captive
        portal. A captive portal is essentially the integration of a
        fi rewall with an authentication web page. 

** Review Questions

    1. Which WLAN security mechanism requires that each WLAN user have
       unique authentication credentials?

       A. WPA-Personal

       B. 802.1X/EAP

       C. Open System

       D. WPA2-Personal

       E. WPA-PSK

       *答案解析*

       B. As required by an 802.1X security solution, the supplicant
       is a WLAN client requesting authentication and access to
       network resources. Each supplicant has unique authentication
       credentials that are verified by the authentication server. 

    2. Which wireless security standards and certifications call for
       the use of CCMP/AES encryption? (Choose all that apply.)

       A. WPA

       B. 802.11-2012

       C. 802.1X

       D. WPA2

       E. 802.11 legacy

       *答案解析*

       B and D. The 802.11-2012 standard defines CCMP/AES encryption
       as the default encryption method, and TKIP/RC4 is the optional
       encryption method. This was originally defined by the 802.11i
       amendment, which is now part of the 802.11-2012 standard. The
       Wi-Fi Alliance created the WPA2 security certification, which
       mirrors the robust security defined by the IEEE. WPA2 supports
       both CCMP/AES and TKIP/RC4 dynamic encryption-key management. 

    3. 128-bit WEP encryption uses a user-provided static key of what
       size?

       A. 104 bytes

       B. 64 bits

       C. 124 bits

       D. 128 bits

       E. 104 bits

       *答案解析*

       E. 128-bit WEP encryption uses a secret 104-bit static key that
       is provided by the user (26 hex characters) and combined with a
       24-bit initialization vector (IV) for an effective key strength of 128 bits.

    4. What three main components constitute an 802.1X/EAP framework?
       (Choose all that apply.)

       A. Supplicant

       B. Authorizer

       C. Authentication server

       D. Intentional radiator

       E. Authenticator

       *答案解析*

       A, C and E. The supplicant, authenticator, and authentication
       server work together to provide the framework for an 802.1X/EAP
       solution. The supplicant requests access to network
       resources. The authentication server authenticates the identity
       of the supplicant, and the authenticator allows or denies
       access to network resources via virtual ports.

    5. The 802.11 legacy standard defines which wireless security
       solution?

       A. Dynamic WEP

       B. 802.1X/EAP

       C. 64-bit static WEP

       D. Temporal Key Integrity Protocol

       E. CCMP/AES

       *答案解析*

       C. The original 802.11 standard ratified in 1997 defined the
       use of a 64-bit or 128-bit static encryption solution called
       Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP). Dynamic WEP was never defined
       under any wireless security standard. The use of 802.1X/EAP,
       TKIP/RC4, and CCMP/AES are all defined under the current
       802.11-2012 standard. 

    6. Paul has been hired as a consultant to secure the Levasseur
       Corporation’s WLAN infrastructure. He has been asked to choose
       a solution that will both protect the company’s equipment from
       theft and hopefully protect the access point’s configuration
       interfaces from outside attackers. What recommendations would
       be appropriate? (Choose all that apply.) 

       A. Mounting all access points in lockable enclosure units

       B. Using an IPsec VPN

       C. Configuring all access points via Telnet

       D. Configuring access points from the wired side using HTTPS or
       SSH

       E. Implementing 802.1X/EAP

       *答案解析*

       A, D and E. Access points may be mounted in lockable enclosure
       units to provide theft protection. All access points should be
       configured from the wired side and never wirelessly. Encrypted
       management interfaces such as HTTPS and SSH should be used
       instead of HTTP or Telnet. An 802.1X/EAP solution guarantees
       that only authorized users will receive an IP
       address. Attackers can get an IP address prior to setting up an
       IPsec VPN tunnel and potentially attack the access points. 

    7. Which security solutions may be used to segment a wireless LAN?
       (Choose all that apply.)

       A. VLAN

       B. WEP

       C. RBAC

       D. CCMP/AES

       E. TKIP/RC4

       *答案解析*

       A and C. Virtual LANs are used to segment wireless users at
       layer 3. The most common wireless segmentation strategy often
       used in 802.11 enterprise WLANs is segmentation using VLANS
       combined with role-based access control (RBAC)
       mechanisms. CCMP/AES, TKIP/RC4, and WEP are encryption
       solutions. 

    8. What wireless security solutions are defined by Wi-Fi Protected
       Access? (Choose all that apply.)

       A. Passphrase authentication

       B. LEAP

       C. TKIP/RC4

       D. Dynamic WEP

       E. CCMP/AES

       *答案解析*

       A and C. The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) certification was a
       snapshot of the not-yetreleased 802.11i amendment, supporting
       only the TKIP/RC4 dynamic encryption-key generation. 802.1X/EAP
       authentication was required in the enterprise, and passphrase
       authentication was required in a SOHO or home environment. LEAP
       is Cisco proprietary and is not specifically defined by
       WPA. Neither dynamic WEP nor CCMP/AES was defined for
       encryption. CCMP/AES dynamic encryption is mandatory under the
       WPA2 certification. 

    9. Name the three main components of a role-based access control
       solution.

       A. EAP

       B. Roles

       C. Encryption

       D. Permissions

       E. Users

       *答案解析*

       B, D and E. Role-based access control (RBAC) is an approach to
       restricting system access to authorized users. The three main
       components of an RBAC approach are users, roles, and
       permissions. 

    10. What does 802.1X/EAP provide when implemented for WLAN
        security? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. Access to network resources

        B. Verification of access point credentials

        C. Dynamic authentication

        D. Dynamic encryption-key generation

        E. Verification of user credentials

        *答案解析*

        A, D and E. The purpose of 802.1X/EAP is authentication of
        user credentials and authorization to network
        resources. Although the 802.1X/EAP framework does not require
        encryption, it highly suggests the use of encryption. A
        by-product of 802.1X/EAP is the generation and distribution of
        dynamic encryption keys.  

    11. Which technologies use the RC4 cipher? (Choose all that
        apply.)

        A. Static WEP

        B. Dynamic WEP

        C. CCMP

        D. TKIP

        E. MPPE

        *答案解析*

        A, B, D and E. All forms of WEP encryption use the Rivest
        Cipher 4 (RC4) algorithm. TKIP is WEP that has been enhanced
        and also uses the RC4 cipher. PPTP uses 128-bit Microsoft
        Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE), which uses the RC4
        algorithm. CCMP uses the AES cipher. 

    12. What must occur to generate dynamic TKIP/RC4 or CCMP/AES
        encryption keys? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. Shared Key authentication and 4-Way Handshake

        B. 802.1X/EAP authentication and 4-Way Handshake

        C. Static WEP and 4-Way Handshake

        D. PSK authentication and 4-Way Handshake

        *答案解析*

        B and D. Shared Key authentication is a legacy authentication
        method that does not provide seeding material to generate
        dynamic encryption keys. Static WEP uses static keys. A robust
        security network association requires a four-frame EAP
        exchange known as the 4-Way Handshake that is used to generate
        dynamic TKIP or CCMP keys. The handshake may occur either
        after an 802.1X/EAP exchange or as a result of PSK authentication.

    13. For an 802.1X/EAP solution to work properly, which two
        components must both support the same type of EAP? (Choose all
        that apply.)

        A. Supplicant

        B. Authorizer

        C. Authenticator

        D. Authentication server

        *答案解析*

        A and D. An 802.1X/EAP solution requires that both the
        supplicant and the authentication server support the same type
        of EAP. The authenticator must be configured for 802.1X/EAP
        authentication but does not care which EAP type passes
        through. The authenticator and the supplicant must support the
        same type of encryption. 

    14. When you’re using an 802.11 wireless controller solution,
        which device would be usually function as the authenticator? 

        A. Access point

        B. LDAP server

        C. WLAN controller

        D. RADIUS server

        *答案解析*

        C. WLAN controllers use lightweight access points, which are
        dumb terminals with radio cards and antennas. The WLAN
        controller is the authenticator. When an 802.1X/EAP solution
        is deployed in a wireless controller environment, the virtual
        controlled and uncontrolled ports exist on the WLAN
        controller. 

    15. Identify some aspects of the Temporal Key Integrity
        Protocol. (Choose all that apply.) 

        A. 128-bit temporal key

        B. 24-bit initialization vector

        C. Message integrity check

        D. 48-bit IV

        E. Diffie-Hellman Exchange

        *答案解析*

        A, C and D. TKIP starts with a 128-bit temporal key that is
        combined with a 48-bit initialization vector (IV) and source
        and destination MAC addresses in a process known as per-packet
        key mixing. TKIP uses an additional data integrity check known
        as the message integrity check (MIC). 

    16. In a point-to-point bridge environment where 802.1X/EAP is
        used for bridge authentication, what device in the network
        acts as the 802.1X supplicant? 

        A. Nonroot bridge

        B. Controller

        C. Root bridge

        D. RADIUS server

        E. Layer 3 core switch

        *答案解析*

        A. The root bridge would be the authenticator, and the nonroot
        bridge would be the supplicant if 802.1X/EAP security is used
        in a WLAN bridged network. 

    17. CCMP encryption uses which AES key size?

        A. 192 bits

        B. 64 bits

        C. 256 bits

        D. 128 bits

        *答案解析*

        D. The AES algorithm encrypts data in fixed data blocks with
        choices in encryptionkey strength of 128, 192, or 256
        bits. CCMP/AES uses a 128-bit encryption-key size and encrypts
        in 128-bit fixed-length blocks. 

    18. Identify the security solutions that are defined by
        WPA2. (Choose all that apply.)

        A. 802.1X/EAP authentication

        B. Dynamic WEP encryption

        C. Optional CCMP/AES encryption

        D. Passphrase authentication

        E. DES encryption

        *答案解析*

        A and D. The WPA2 certification requires the use of an
        802.1X/EAP authentication method in the enterprise and the use
        of a preshared key or a passphrase in a SOHO environment. The
        WPA2 certification also requires the use of stronger dynamic
        encryption-key generation methods. CCMP/AES encryption is the
        mandatory encryption method, and TKIP/RC4 is the optional
        encryption method. 

    19. What encryption method does the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard
        mandate for robust security network associations and what
        method is optional? 

        A. WEP, AES

        B. IPsec, AES

        C. MPPE, TKIP

        D. TKIP, WEP

        E. CCMP, TKIP

        *答案解析*

        E. The 802.11-2012 standard defines what is known as a robust
        security network (RSN) and robust security network
        associations (RSNAs). CCMP/AES encryption is the mandated
        encryption method, and TKIP/RC4 is an optional encryption
        method. 

    20. Which layer 2 protocol is used for authentication in an 802.1X
        framework?
        
        A. Extensible Authorization Protocol

        B. Extended Authentication Protocol

        C. Extensible Authentication Protocol

        D. CHAP/PPP

        E. Open System

        *答案解析*

        C. The supplicant, authenticator, and authentication server
        work together to provide the framework for 802.1X port-based
        access control, and an authentication protocol is needed to
        assist in the authentication process. The Extensible
        Authentication Protocol (EAP) is used to provide user
        authentication.

** Site survey defined

    the site survey must encompass so much more than just determining
    coverage, including looking for potential sources of interference
    as well as the proper placement, installation, and confi guration
    of 802.11 hardware and related components. 
    
*** Protocol and spectrum analysis
    
        分析收包包的信息，SSID，BSSID以及相关的安全信息，同时检测信号
        强度的变化。

        Wi-Fi-oriented spectrum and protocol analyzers fall into two
        categories: standalone and Integrated

*** Standalone

        Wi-Fi接收器和频谱分析仪分别独立工作获取不同的信息，相互之间是
        独立的。

*** Integrated

       将Wi-Fi网卡与频谱分析仪获取的信息进行综合，可以通过软件提供更专
       业的信息。

*** Spectrum analysis
    
        在进行覆盖分析测试之间，必须先定位干扰源。
        
        如果背景噪声信号强度超过了-85dBm，则无线网络的性能半会受到极大
        影响。

        这种环境下，也会导致Layer 2重传率升高，当超过10%的重传率时，网
        络吞吐量将会受到极大影响。

* 第十八章 802.11n

** 802.11n-2009 amendment
   
     802.11n-2009定义了HT， 无线通信可以结合MIMO技术和OFDM技术。 MIMO
     技术提高了吞吐量和通信范围。802.11n向后与802.11a/b/g保持兼容。
     802.11n可使用在2.4G和5G。

** Wi-Fi Alliance certification
      
      Wi-Fi联盟针对802.11n有一个厂商认证项目称为WiFi CERTIFIED n。
      802.11n的产品必须通过一些强制测试项和可选项。所有认证过的802.11n
      设备必须支持Wi-Fi多媒体的QoS机制和WPA/WPA2的安全机制。

** MIMO
     
     MIMO是支持802.11n物理层的核心和灵魂。对于传统的802.11设备，多径是
     一个会导致信号衰减或数据破坏的问题，但是，对于802.11n设备，多径效
     应却是一个可利用的现象，802.11n就是充分利用多径效应来提高网络吞吐
     量的。

     MIMO信号发射端发射的信息会通过多条路径到达MIMO信号接收端，MIMO信
     号接收端会使用高级的DSP技术挑选出原始的传输信号。

     通过使用SM（spatial multiplexing）方法传输多个数据流，可以利用多
     径提供更好的吞吐量。MIMO系统也可以同时使用多条天线来提供更好的传
     输和接收差异， 这可以增大传输范围和可靠性。

     有许多传输和接收差异的技术：
     1. Space-time block coding (STBC) and cyclic shift diversity
        (CSD) are transmit diversity techniques where the same
        transmit data is sent out of multiple antennas.
        STBC技术只能用于802.11n设备之间，而CSD技术可以用于802.11n设备
        和其他类型的设备。
     2. Transmit beamforming (TxBF) is a technique where the same
        signal is transmitted over multiple antennas and the antennas
        act like a phased array.
     3. Maximal ratio combining (MRC) is a type of receive diversity
        technique where multiple received signals are combined, thus
        improving sensitivity.

     空间利用和差异化技术是利用多径的重要技术。

     [[./images/2015/2015121101.png]]

*** Radio chains

      A radio chain is defined as a single radio and all of its
      supporting architecture, including mixers, amplifiers, and
      analog/digital converters.

      一个MIMO系统包含多个Radio Chain，每个Radio Chain都有自己的天线。
      一个MIMO系统是以发送端和接收端使用的Radio Chain为特征的。一个
      2X3MIMO系统代表有三个Radio Chain由2个发送端和3个接收端使用。

      #+CAPTION: 2×3 and 3×3 MIMO
      [[./images/2015/2015121102.png]]

*** Spatial multiplexing (SM)

      A MIMO radio also has the ability to send independent unique
      data streams. Each independent data stream is known as a
      =spatial stream=. 每个单独的Spatial Stream包含的数据可以跟其他的
      Radio Chain传送的数据不一样。 

      Each stream will also travel a different path, because there is
      at least a half-wavelength of space between the multiple
      transmitting antennas. The fact that the multiple streams follow
      different paths to the receiver because of the space between the
      transmitting antennas is known as /spatial diversity/.

      Sending multiple independent streams of unique data using
      spatial diversity is often also referred to as spatial
      multiplexing (SM) or spatial diversity multiplexing (SDM).

      描述MIMO能力的格式： 3×3:2
      第一个数字代表TX数量，第二个数字代表RX数量，第三个代表发送或
      接收唯一的数据流数量。

      #+CAPTION: Multiple spatial streams
      [[./images/2015/2015121103.png]]

      当一个STA加入一个BSS时，STA会将MIMO能力信息告知给AP。

*** MIMO diversity

      Antenna diversity (both receive and transmit) is a method of
      using multiple antennas to survive the negative effects of
      multipath.

      接收端从收到的信号中，提取信号最强的。使用多根天线增加了信号被接
      收到的概率，从而降低数据破坏的概率，实际效果是信号传输距离变长了。

*** Space-time block coding (STBC)

       Space-time block coding (STBC) is a method where the same
       information is transmitted on two or more antennas. It is a
       type of transmit diversity.

       当天线数量超过spatial streams数量时，可以使用STBC。STBC并不能增
       加数据传输速率，但是可以增强接收端在SNR较小的时候可以检测到信号。
       无线信号系统的接收灵敏度增强了。STBC主要用于802.11n设备之间的数
       据传输。

*** Cyclic shift diversity (CSD)

       另一种比较重要的Transmit Diversity技术，可以用于802.11n设备与传
       统802.11设备之间的数据传输。

*** Transmit beamforming (TxBF)

       802.11n标准中定义的一种可选的物理层能力。Transmit beamforming
       can be used when there are more transmitting antennas than
       there are spatial data streams.

       接收端通过调整信号的相位，得到一个较高振幅的信号，提高了SNR，增
       大了数据传输距离。

** HT channels

*** 20 MHz non-HT and HT channels

        802.11n (HT) radios also use the same OFDM technology and have
        the capability of using either 20 MHz channels or 40 MHz
        channels. The 20 MHz channels used by HT radios have four
        extra subcarriers and can carry a little more data than a
        non-HT OFDM channel.

        #+CAPTION: 20 MHz non-HT (802.11a/g) channel
        [[./images/2015/2015121104.png]]

        #+CAPTION: 20 MHz HT (802.11n) channel
        [[./images/2015/2015121105.png]]

*** 40 MHz channels

        #+CAPTION: 40 MHz HT (802.11n) channel
        [[./images/2015/2015121106.png]]

        40MHz的信道是由两个相邻的20MHz信道合并的，其中一个为主信道，另
        一个为辅信道。
    
*** 40 MHz Intolerant

        2.4G频段，只有一个不重叠的40 MHz的信道。 一个在2.4G使用40 MHz信道宽
        度的AP会影响周围其他的AP，如果该AP运行在2.4G，并使用20 MHz信道
        宽度， 如1， 6 ， 11信道。默认情况下，802.11 STA和AP在2.4G频段
        传输数据时会使用20 MHz的信道宽度。 它们也可以通过802.11n管理帧
        告知周围其他设备它们是 /Forty MHz Intolerant/ 。 当2.4G下使用
        40 MHz信道宽度的AP收到这样的管理帧后，会自动切回到20 MHz的信道
        宽度。对于运行于5G下的AP，则没有这样的要求。

*** Guard interval (GI)

       For digital signals, data is modulated onto the carrier signal
       in bits or collections of bits called /symbols/.

       802.11a/g radios use an 800-nanosecond guard interval (GI)
       between OFDM symbols. The =guard interval= is a period of time
       between symbols that accommodates the late arrival of symbols
       over long paths.

       In a multipath environment, symbols travel different paths, and
       therefore some symbols arrive later. A “new” symbol may arrive
       at a receiver before a “late” symbol has been completely
       received. This is known as /intersymbol interference (ISI)/ and
       often results in data corruption.

       =delay spread= is the time differential between multiple paths
       of the same signal. 通过delay spread的大小为50 ns ~ 100 ns, 最
       多不超过200 ns. Guard interval通常是2到4倍delay spread的大小。

       #+CAPTION: Guard interval
       [[./images/2015/2015121107.png]]
       
       GI的主要作用是防止 =Inter symbol inerference=.
    
*** Modulation and coding scheme (MCS)

       802.11n data rates are defined with a modulation and coding
       scheme (MCS) matrix.

*** HT PHY

       MSDU是Layer3~7层的负载。 MPDU是整个802.11帧的技术名称。当MPDU转
       到物理层后，前导码和PHY头部信息加入到MPDU，产生了 /Physical
       Layer Convergence Procedure Protocol Data Unit (PPDU)./
       前导码的作用是使用一些比特位同步两个802.11无线信号传输。PHY头部
       的主要目的是使用一个Signal域显示要花多长时间去传输802.11帧
       （MPDU），并通知接收方当前传输MPDU使用的MCS（速率）。 

       #+CAPTION: 802.11n PPDU formats
       [[./images/2015/2015121108.png]]

*** Non-HT legacy

       Support for the non-HT legacy format is mandatory for 802.11n
       radios, and transmissions can occur in only 20 MHz channels.

*** HT Mixed

       The HT Mixed format is also considered mandatory, and
       transmissions can occur in both 20 MHz and 40 MHz channels.

       When a 40 MHz channel is used, all broadcast traffic must be
       sent on a legacy 20 MHz channel so as to maintain
       interoperability with the 802.11a/g non-HT clients.

*** HT Greenfield

      Greenfield format is optional, and the HT radios can transmit
      by using both 20 MHz and 40 MHz channels..

      这种模式不能兼容802.11a/b/g设备，也没有要求使用保护机制。

** HT MAC

     针对MAC逻辑链路子层， 也提供了一些机制来增强吞吐量，改进电源管理
     功能： 使用帧聚合。 

*** A-MSDU

       802.11设备传输帧时，使用竞争机制来获取媒介使用权，这样会产生一
       些通信开锁，且是无法避免的。 为了降低通信开销，802.11n引入了两
       个新的帧聚合方法来帮助降低开销。 

       第一种方法是： /Aggregate MAC Service Data Unit(A-MSDU)/ 。 

       #+CAPTION: A-MSDU
       [[./images/2015/2015121109.png]]
     
*** A-MPDU

      The second method of frame aggregation is known as /Aggregate
      MAC Protocol Data Unit (A-MPDU)/.

      #+CAPTION: A-MPDU
      [[./images/2015/2015121110.png]]

*** Block Acknowledgment

      A-MSDU只需要 一个ACK，但是，A-MPDU需要对其中的每个MPDU进行确认，
      这是通过 /multiple traffic ID block acknowledgment (MTBA)
      frame/ 来完成的，它实际上是一个A-MPDU的Block ACK帧。 

*** RIFS

       802.11n引入了一个更短的帧间间隔 /reduced interframe space
       (RIFS)/ 。 

*** HT power management

       802.11e QoS修订版引入了unscheduled automatic power save
       delivery (U-APSD), 这个是WMM-PS使用的机制。11n引入了另外两个新
       的省电机制。

      1. spatial multiplexing power save(SM power save)
         这个机制允许一个使用MIMO技术的11n设备保留一个radio活跃的情况下，
         关闭所有其他的radio。 
         使用SM power save action帧来告知AP当前STA的ratio活跃状况。王

      2. Power Save Multi Poll (PSMP)
         对APSD和U-APSD的一个扩展

** HT operation

*** 20/40 channel operation

       Several rules apply for the operation of 20 MHz and 40 MHz
       stations within the same HT 20/40 basic service set:

      - The 802.11n access point must declare 20-only or 20/40 support
        in the beacon management frame.

      -  802.11n client stations must declare 20-only or 20/40 in the
         association or reassociation frames.

      - Client stations must reassociate when switching between
        20-only and 20/40 modes.

      -  If 20/40-capable stations transmit by using a single 20 MHz
         channel, they must transmit on the primary channel and not
         the secondary channel.

*** HT protection modes (0–3)

       在Beacon帧中，有一个HT Protection的域，它有4个可能的值0~3. 保护
       模式会动态变化，取决于周围的设备或者关联的HT AP。使用的保护机制
       主要有：RTS/CTS, CTS-to-Self, Dual-CTS或者其他的保护方法。 

       4种保护模式：
       1) Mode 0—Greenfield (No Protection) Mode
           This mode is referred to as Greenfield because only HT
          radios are in use.

       2) Mode 1—HT Nonmember Protection Mode
           在该模式下，BSS中所有的STA都必须是HT STA.

       3) Mode 2—HT 20 MHz Protection Mode
           the 20/40-capable HT stations must use protection when
          transmitting on a 40 MHz channel in order to prevent the 20
          MHz–only HT stations from transmitting at the same time. 

       4) Mode 3—Non-HT Mixed Mode
           This protection mode is used when one or more non-HT
          stations are associated to the HT access point.

*** RTS/CTS and CTS-to-self
         主要用于保护HT STA数据传输。

** Review Questions

    1. Thirty 2×2:2 access points have been deployed at a school
       where all the client devices are 1×1:1 802.11n tablets. The
       access points are transmitting on 20 MHz channels with the
       standard guard interval of 800 ns. What is the highest 802.11n
       data rate that can be used for communications between the APs
       and tablets? 

       A. 54 Mbps

       B. 65 Mbps

       C. 72 Mbps

       D. 150 Mbps

       E. 300 Mbps

       *答案解析*

       B. The majority of enterprise 802.1n access points are either
       2×2:2 or 3×3:3. However, most 802.11n mobile devices, such as
       smartphones and tablets, only have a 1×1:1 MIMO radio because
       the addition of more radio chains would drain the battery life
       of the mobile device too quickly. In the described scenario,
       the highest available data rate for 1×1:1 communications is 65
       Mbps. 

    2. How can a MIMO system increase throughput at the Physical
       layer? (Choose all that apply.)

       A. Spatial multiplexing

       B. A-MPDU

       C. Transmit beamforming

       D. 40 MHz channels

       E. Dual-CTS protection

       *答案解析*

       A, C and D. Spatial multiplexing transmits multiple streams of
       unique data at the same time. If a MIMO access point sends two
       unique data streams to a MIMO client who receives both streams,
       the throughput is effectively doubled. If a MIMO access point
       sends three unique data streams to a MIMO client who receives
       all three streams, the throughput is effectively
       tripled. Because transmit beamforming results in constructive
       multipath communication, the result is a higher signal-to-noise
       ratio and greater received amplitude. Transmit beamforming will
       result in higher throughput because of the higher SNR that
       allows for the use of more complex modulation methods that can
       encode more data bits. 40 MHz HT channels effectively double
       the frequency bandwidth，which results in greater
       throughput. A-MPDU and Dual-CTS protection are MAC layer
       mechanisms. 

    3. Which new power-management method defined by the 802.11n
       amendment conserves power by powering down all but one radio?

       A. A-MPDU

       B. Power Save protection

       C. PSMP

       D. SM power save

       E. PS mode

       *答案解析*

       D. Spatial multiplexing power save (SM power save) allows a
       MIMO 802.11n device to power down all but one of its
       radios. For example, a 4×4 MIMO device with four radio chains
       would power down three of the four radios, thus conserving
       power. SM power save defines two methods of operation: static
       and dynamic. 

    4. The guard interval is used as a buffer to compensate for what
       type of interference?

       A. Co-channel interference

       B. Adjacent cell interference

       C. RF interference

       D. HT interference

       E. Intersymbol interference

       *答案解析*

       E. The guard interval acts as a buffer for the delay spread,
       and the normal guard interval is an 800-nanosecond buffer
       between symbol transmissions. The guard interval will
       compensate for the delay spread and help prevent intersymbol
       interference. If the guard interval is too short, intersymbol
       interference will still occur. HT radios also have the
       capability of using a shorter 400-nanosecond GI. 

    5. Name some of the factors that a modulation and coding scheme
       (MCS) uses to define data rates for an HT radio. (Choose all
       that apply.) 

       A. Modulation method

       B. Equal/unequal modulation

       C. Number of spatial streams

       D. GI

       E. Channel size

       *答案解析*

       A, B, C, D and E. HT radios use modulation and coding schemes
       to define data rates based on numerous factors, including
       modulation type, the number of spatial streams, channel size,
       guard interval, equal/unequal modulation, and other
       factors. Each modulation and coding scheme (MCS) is a variation
       of these multiple factors. A total of 77 modulation and coding
       schemes exist for both 20 MHz HT channels and 40 MHz HT
       channels. 

    6. How can an HT radio increase throughput at the MAC sublayer of
       the Data-Link layer? (Choose all that apply.)

       A. A-MSDU

       B. RIFS

       C. A-MPDU

       D. Guard interval

       E. MTBA

       *答案解析*

       A, B, C and E. The 802.11n amendment introduces two new methods
       of frame aggregation to help reduce overhead and increase
       throughput. Frame aggregation is a method of combining multiple
       frames into a single frame transmission. The two types of frame
       aggregation are A-MSDU and A-MPDU. Multiple traffic ID block
       acknowledgment (MTBA) frames are used to acknowledge
       A-MPDUs. Block ACKs result in less overhead. RIFS is a
       2-microsecond interframe space that can be used in an HT
       Greenfield network during frame bursts. The 2-microsecond
       interframe space is less overhead than the more commonly used
       SIFS. Guard intervals are used at the Physical layer.

    7. Transmit beamforming uses what type of frames to analyze the
       MIMO channel before transmitting directed paths of data? 

       A. Trigger frames

       B. Beaming frames

       C. Sounding frames

       D. SM power save action frames

       *答案解析*

       C. An 802.11n transmitter that uses beamforming will try to
       adjust the phase of the signals based on feedback from the
       receiver using sounding frames. The transmitter is considered
       the beamformer, and the receiver is considered the
       beamformee. The beamformer and the beamformee work together to
       educate each other about the characteristics of the MIMO channel.

    8. A 3×3:2 MIMO radio can transmit and receive how many unique
       streams of data?

       A. Two.

       B. Three.

       C. Four.

       D. Three equal and four unequal streams.

       E. None—the streams are not unique data.

       *答案解析*

       A. MIMO radios transmit multiple radio signals at the same time
       and take advantage of multipath. Each individual radio signal
       is transmitted by a unique radio and antenna of the MIMO
       system. Each independent signal is known as a spatial stream,
       and each stream can contain different data than the other
       streams transmitted by one or more of the other radios. A
       3×3:2 MIMO system can transmit two unique data streams. A
       3×3:2 MIMO system would use three transmitters and three
       receivers; however, only two unique data streams are utilized. 

    9. Name a capability not defined for A-MPDU.

       A. Multiple QoS access categories

       B. Independent data payload encryption

       C. Individual MPDUs having the same receiver address

       D. MPDU aggregation

       *答案解析*

       A. Multiple MPDUs can be aggregated into one frame. The
       individual MPDUs within an A-MPDU must all have the same
       receiver address. However, individual MPDUs must all be of the
       same 802.11e quality-of-service access category. 

    10. Which HT protection modes allow only for the association of HT
        stations in the HT basic service set? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. Mode 0—Greenfield mode

        B. Mode 1—HT nonmember protection mode

        C. Mode 2—HT 20 MHz protection mode

        D. Mode 3—HT Mixed mode

        *答案解析*

        A, B and C. Modes 0, 1, and 2 all define protection to be used
        in various situations where only HT stations are allowed to
        associate to an HT access point. Mode 3—HT Mixed mode—defines
        the use of protection when both HT and non-HT radios are
        associated to an HT access point. 

    11. Which of these capabilities are considered mandatory for an
        802.11n access point as defined by the Wi-Fi Alliance’s
        vendor certification program called Wi-Fi CERTIFIED n? (Choose
        all that apply.) 

        A. Three spatial streams in receive mode

        B. WPA/WPA2

        C. WMM

        D. Two spatial streams in transmit mode

        E. 2.4 GHz–40 MHz channels

        *答案解析*

        B, C and D. Some of the mandatory baseline requirements of
        Wi-Fi CERTIFIED n include WPA/WPA2 certification, WMM
        certification, and support for 40 MHz channels in the 5 GHz
        U-NII bands. 40 MHz channels in 2.4 GHz are not
        required. 802.11n access points must support at least two
        spatial streams in both transmit and receive mode. Client
        stations must support one spatial stream or better. 

    12. MIMO radios use which mechanisms for transmit diversity?
        (Choose all that apply.)

        A. Maximum ratio combining (MRC)

        B. Spatial multiplexing (SM)

        C. Space-time block coding (STBC)

        D. Cyclic shift diversity (CSD)

        E. Multiple traffic ID block acknowledgment (MTBA)

        *答案解析*

        C and D. Cyclic shift diversity (CSD) is a method of transmit
        diversity technique specified in the 802.11n standard. Unlike
        STBC, a signal from a transmitter that uses CSD can be
        received by legacy 802.11g and 802.11a devices. Maximum ratio
        combining (MRC) is a method of receive diversity.

    13. 802.11n (HT) radios are backward compatible with which of the
        following types of 802.11 radios? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. 802.11b radios (HR-DSSS)

        B. 802.11a radios (OFDM)

        C. 802.11 legacy radios (FHSS)

        D. 802.11g radios (ERP)

        *答案解析*

        A, B and D. 802.11n (HT) radios are backward compatible with
        older 802.11b radios (HR-DSSS), 802.11a radios (OFDM), and
        802.11g radios (ERP). HT radios are not backward compatible
        with legacy frequency hopping radios. 

    14. How does transmit beamforming (TxBF) use multiple MIMO
        antennas to increase range? 

        A. Beamsteering

        B. Phase shifting

        C. Dynamic beamforming

        D. Spatial multiplexing

        *答案解析*

        B. Transmit beamforming is a method that allows a MIMO
        transmitter using multiple antennas to adjust the phase of the
        outgoing transmissions in a coordinated method. If the
        transmitter (TX) knows about the receiver’s location, the
        phase of the multiple signals sent by a MIMO transmitter can
        be adjusted. When the multiple signals arrive at the receiver,
        they are in phase, resulting in constructive multipath instead
        of the destructive multipath caused by out-of-phase
        signals. Beamsteering and dynamic beamforming use smart
        antenna technology to create directional beams. 

    15. Which HT PPDU formats support both 20 MHz and 40 MHz channels?
        (Choose all that apply.)

        A. Non-HT legacy format

        B. PCO mode

        C. HT Mixed format

        D. HT Greenfield format

        *答案解析*

        C and D. The HT Mixed format is considered mandatory, and
        transmissions can occur in both 20 MHz and 40 MHz
        channels. Support for the HT Greenfield format is optional,
        and the HT radios can transmit by using both 20 MHz and 40 MHz
        channels。 Support for the non-HT legacy format is mandatory
        for 802.11n radios, and transmissions can occur in only 20 MHz
        channels. PCO is not a PPDU format. 

    16. A WLAN consultant has recommend that a new 802.11n HT network
        be deployed by using channels in the 5 GHz U-NII bands. Why
        would he recommend 5 GHz over 2.4 GHz? 

        A. HT radios do not require DFS and TPC in the 5 GHz bands.

        B. HT radios get better range using TxBF in the 5 GHz bands.

        C. 40 MHz channels do not scale in the 2.4 GHz ISM band.

        D. 5 GHz HT radios are less expensive than 2.4 GHz HT radios.

        *答案解析*

        C. Deploying 40 MHz HT channels at 2.4 GHz does not scale
        properly in multiple channel architecture. Although 14
        channels are available at 2.4 GHz, there are only 3
        nonoverlapping 20 MHz channels available in the 2.4 GHz ISM
        band. When the smaller channels are bonded together to form 40
        MHz channels in the 2.4 GHz ISM band, any two 40 MHz channels
        will overlap. Channel reuse patterns are not possible with 40
        MHz channels in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. 

    17. What 802.11n mode of operation sends the same data on two
        adjacent 20 MHz channels? 

        A. Greenfield mode

        B. HT Mixed mode

        C. Non-HT duplicate mode

        D. LDPC mode

        *答案解析*

        C. Non-HT duplicate transmissions will be sent using 802.11a
        data rates in the 5 GHz band or 802.11g data rates in the 2.4
        GHz band. Non-HT duplicate transmissions are just sending the
        same data on two adjacent 20 MHz (52 subcarriers) OFDM
        channels at the same time. This will cause STAs operating in
        either the primary or secondary channel to update their NAVs
        and defer their transmissions. Non-HT duplicate mode improves
        error rate performance but is not widely implemented by WLAN
        vendors. 

    18. What frequencies are defined for 802.11n (HT) radio
        transmissions? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. 902–928 MHz

        B. 2.4–2.4835 GHz

        C. 5.15–5.25 GHz

        D. 5.25–5.35 MHz

        *答案解析*

        B and C. Other 802.11 technologies are frequency dependent on
        a single RF band. For example, 802.11b/g radios can transmit
        in only the 2.4 GHz ISM band. 802.11a are restricted to the 5
        GHz U-NII bands. 802.11n radios are not locked to a single
        frequency band and can transmit on both the 2.4 GHz ISM band
        and the 5 GHz U-NII bands. 

    19. What PHY layer mechanism might be used to increase throughput
        for an HT radio in a clean RF environment with minimal
        reflections and low multipath? 

        A. Maximum ratio combining

        B. 400-nanosecond guard interval

        C. Switched diversity

        D. Spatial multiplexing

        E. Spatial diversity

        *答案解析*

        B. 802.11n also uses an 800-nanosecond guard interval;
        however, a shorter  400-nanosecond guard interval is
        optional. A shorter guard interval results in a shorter symbol
        time, which has the effect of increasing data rates by about
        10 percent. If the optional shorter 400-nanosecond guard
        interval is used with an 802.11n radio, throughput should
        increase. However, if intersymbol interference occurs because
        of multipath, the result is data corruption. If data
        corruption occurs, layer 2 retransmissions will increase and
        the throughput will be adversely affected. Therefore, a
        400-nanosecond guard interval should be used in only good RF
        environments. If throughput goes down because of a shorter GI
        setting, the default guard interval setting of 800 nanoseconds
        should be used instead. 

    20. What PHY layer mechanisms might be used to increase the range
        for an 802.11n radio using a MIMO system? (Choose all that
        apply.) 

        A. Maximum ratio combining

        B. Guard interval

        C. Transmit beamforming

        D. Spatial multiplexing

        *答案解析*

        A and C. As the distance between a transmitter and receiver
        increases, the received signal amplitude decreases to levels
        closer to the noise floor. Maximum ratio combining (MRC)
        algorithms are used to combine multiple received signals by
        looking at each unique signal and optimally combining the
        signals in a method that is additive as opposed to
        destructive. MIMO systems using both switched diversity and
        MRC together will effectively raise the SNR level of the
        received signal. Because transmit beamforming results in
        constructive multipath communication, the result is a higher
        signal-to-noise ratio and greater received
        amplitude. Therefore, transmit beamforming will result in
        greater range for individual clients communicating with an
        access point. 

* 第十九章 VHT & 802.11ac
  
** 802.11ac 2003修订版
   802.11ac是分阶段实现的，第一阶段目标是传输速率达到1.3Gbps， 第二阶
   段目标是传输速率达到3.5Gbps。 

   与802.11n对比情况如下：

   [[./images/2016/2016042601.png]]

** 5 GHz only
   802.11ac由于支持更高的带宽，所以只能工作在5G频段上。

** 20,40,80,160 MHz信道

   11ac在11n的基础上，引入了80MHz，160MHz的带宽。其中，40MHz带宽信道是
   由两个相邻的20MHz信道组合而成，80MHz带宽信道是由两个相邻的40MHz信
   道组合而成，160MHz是由两个相邻或独立的两个80MHz信道构成。

   [[./images/2016/2016042602.png]]

   对于11n设备，当他们使用40MHz带宽传输数据时，必须等待Primary Channel
   和Secondary Channel都空闲的情况下，才能进行数据传输。显然会影响11n
   设备的性能。

   11ac设备引入了新的功能，允许AP以每帧为单位选择不同的带宽进行传输。
   这种特性称为 /dynamic bandwidth operation/ 。 这样，11ac的AP，如果
   工作在信36，40，44，48上以80MHz带宽进行数据传输，在进行数据传输之前，
   会检查这4个信道是否空闲，如果发现其中36信息被其他AP占用，则会在信道
   44，48上以40Mhz带宽进行数据传输。

** 256 QAM modulation 
   
   新的调整信号方法， 256 QAM is more sensitive to noise and interference.

** Modulation and coding schemes
   
   11ac只定义了10个MCS选项，前8个是必须实现的。
   
   [[./images/2016/2016042603.png]]

   The last column represents the maximum achievable data rate for
   each MCS. The data rate is based on a 20 MHz wide channel, a single 
   spatial stream, and a short guard interval (400 ns). 

   11ac不能单独禁用某一个速率，但是支持三个选择： /MCS 0-7,MCS 0-8, or MCS 0-9./

** Single User MIMO
   
** 802.11ac date Rates

   相对于11n，11ac主要在如下几个方面进行了增强，以提升数据传输速率。
   1. 采用 =256-QAM= 调制方法

** VHT MAC

   11ac只需要考虑11a, 11n(5G)设备的共存问题。 由于物理层都使用OFDM前导
   码，可以容易计算出等待的时间。

*** =A-MPDU=
    所有11ac数据帧都是使用 =A-MPDU= 帧格式进行传输，即使是只有一个数据
    帧传输。 =A-MPDU= 降低了每帧的开销，只要求一个Block ACK。11n中的
    RIFS不需要了，所以11ac是不支持RIFS的。

*** RTS/CTS
    一个AP如果有准备在4个相邻信道上进行80MHz的数据传输，需要在4个信道
    上发送RTS，然后监听CTS，如果信道不忙，则会收到4个CTS。

    但是，如果4个信道中，有一个或2个信道忙，则AP可能只收到两个CTS，这
    样AP就只能进行40MHz的数据传输。

** Beamforming

   Instead of equally radiating the RF signal, beamforming allows an
   802.11 transmitter to focus or direct the RF energy toward a
   specific client.

   To perform beamforming, the multiple radio chains in the AP
   transmit the same information through different antennas. The APs
   time their transmissions so that the waves of all of the antennas
   arrive at the receiving radio at the same time and in phase with
   each other. This should result in a signal increase of
   approximately 3 decibels.

   
*** Explicit Beamforming
    11n定义了多种beamforming方法，但是11ac只使用explicit beamforming，
    并且要求发送方和接收方都要支持。

    Explicit Beamforming的过程如下：
    1. Beamformer传输一个空数据包（NDP）， 告知beamformee准备进行
       beamformed传输的意图。
    2. The beamformee processes each OFDM subcarrier and creates
       feedback information.
    3. The beamformer uses the feedback matrix to calculate a steering
       matrix that is used to direct the data transmission to the
       beamformee.

    [[./images/2016/2016042604.png]]

*** Multiuser MIMO
    The goal of MU-MIMO is to use as many spatial streams as possible,
    whether the transmission is with one client using four spatial
    streams or with four clients using one spatial stream each.

    MU-MIMO is only supported for downstream transmission from an AP
    to multiple clients.

*** Multiuser Beamforming
    
*** Quality of Service
    
** Infrastructure requirements

** 802.11ac in a SOHO or home

** WFA certification

** Review Questions

    1. Which of the following technologies was optional in 802.11n and
       now mandatory in 802.11ac? 

       A. MIMO

       B. RIFS

       C. A-MPDU

       D. A-MSDU

       E. SU-MIMO

       *答案解析*

       C. 802.11ac requires that all frames are transmitted as
       A-MPDU. MIMO and SUMIMO are synonymous with each other and
       supported in both 802.11n and 802.11ac. A-MSDU is optional with
       both technologies. RIFS is no longer supported and is obsolete.

    2. With the first phase of 802.11ac supporting three spatial
       streams, what is the maximum transmission speed?

       A. 600 Mbps

       B. 1.3 Gbps

       C. 3.5 Gbps
       
       D. 6.933 Gbps

       E. 7.0 Gbps

       *答案解析*

       B. The first phase of 802.11ac supporting three spatials
       streams introduced transmission speeds up to 1.3 Gbps. 600 Mbps
       is the maximum transmission speed for the 802.11n
       amendment. 3.5 Gbps is the expected maximum transmission speed
       of the second phase of 802.11ac, which is expected to support
       four spatial streams. 6.933 Gbps is the maximum transmission
       speed for the 802.11ac amendment. 

    3. Which of the following modulation methods are supported with
       802.11ac? (Choose all that apply.)

       A. BPSK

       B. BASK

       C. 32-QAM

       D. 64-QAM

       E. 256-QAM

       *答案解析*

       A, D and E. The 802.11ac amendment supports BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM,
       64-QAM, and 256-QAM. BASK and 32-QAM do not exist.

    4. Which of the following channel widths are supported in
       802.11ac? (Choose all that apply.) 

       A. 20 MHz

       B. 40 MHz

       C. 80 MHz

       D. 80+80 MHz

       E. 160 MHz

       *答案解析*

       A, B, C, D and E. All of these are supported channel
       widths. The 160 MHz channel is actually made up of two 80 MHz
       channels that can be side by side or separated. 

    5. When a 160 MHz wide channel is used, how many primary channels
        are defined?
        
        A. 1
        
        B. 2

        C. 3

        D. 4

        E. None

       *答案解析*

       C. When a 160 MHz wide channel is used, an 80 MHz, 40 MHz, and
       20 MHz primary channel are defined.

    6. Using 256-QAM, how many bits are represented by each
       subcarrier?

       A. 1

       B. 2

       C. 4

       D. 6

       E. 8

       *答案解析*

       E. With 256-QAM, 256 distinct values can be represented, with
       each subcarrier is capable of representing 8 bits.

    7. How many modulation and coding schemes are defined in 802.11ac?

       A. 8

       B. 10

       C. 64

       D. 77

       E. 256

       *答案解析*

       B. 802.11ac defines only 10 MCSs, unlike 802.11n, which
       defined 77. 802.11n defined MCSs based on modulation, coding
       method, the number of spatial streams, channel size, and guard
       interval. 802.11ac defines 10 MCSs based upon modulation and
       code rate. 

    8. Which 802.11ac MCS range defines all of the MCSs that are
       mandatory?

       A. MCS 0–2

       B. MCS 0–4

       C. MCS 0–6

       D. MCS 0–7

       E. MCS 0–8

       F. MCS 0–9

       *答案解析*

       D. MCS 0–7 are mandatory. MCS 8 and MCS 9 use 256-QAM, which is
       optional but will most likely be supported by most vendors.

    9. The 802.11ac amendment defines a maximum of how many spatial
       streams for an AP, and how many maximum devices can an AP
       communicate with at once?

       A. One spatial stream, four devices

       B. One spatial stream, eight devices

       C. Four spatial streams, four devices

       D. Eight spatial streams, four devices

       E. Eight spatial streams, eight devices

       *答案解析*

       D. The amendment defines a maximum of eight spatial streams and
       only allows MU-MIMO communications with a maximum of four
       devices. 

    10. Requiring all frames to be transmitted as A-MPDU frames
        increases performance due to which of the following? (Choose
        all that apply.) 

        A. Frame overhead is reduced.
        
        B. Block ACK is required.
        
        C. Frame information is shifted from the MPDU header to the PLCP header.
        
        D. Reduced Interframe Space (RIFS) decreases the amount of time between frames.
        
        E. A-MSDU is required; A-MPDU is optional.

        *答案解析*

        A and B. A-MPDU is mandatory for all frames in 802.11ac. It
        reduces the per-frame overhead and requires only a single
        block ACK. Frame information is shifted from the slow PLCP
        header to the faster MPDU header. RIFS is no longer
        supported. 

    11. Which of the following technologies is part of explicit
        beamforming? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. Channel sounding
        
        B. Feedback matrix
        
        C. Sounding matrix
        
        D. Steering matrix
        
        E. Null data packet
        
        F. Channel matrix

        *答案解析*

        B, D and E. The beamformer transmits an NDP announcement frame
        followed by an NDP frame. The beamformee processes this
        information and creates and transmits a feedback matrix. The
        AP uses the feedback matrices to calculate a steering matrix
        that is used to direct the transmission. 

    12. What is the main reason that many smartphones do not support
        multiple spatial streams?

        A. It is difficult to install multiple antennas in the smart phone.
        
        B. The size of the necessary technology would make the smartphone larger than desired.
        
        C. Battery consumption would be too great.
        
        D. Most smartphones actually do support four spatial streams.

        *答案解析*

        C. Due to technology costs and battery consumption, many
        smartphones only support a single stream of data.

    13. Which of the following are QoS categories? (Choose all that
        apply.)

        A. =AC_VO= (access category voice)
        
        B. =AC_DA= (access category data)
        
        C. =AC_VI= (access category video)
        
        D. =AC_BE= (access category best effort)
        
        E. =AC_BK= (access category background)

        *答案解析*

        A, C, D and E. =AC_DA= is not a QoS category.

    14. When transmitting a QoS frame using MU-MIMO, which of the
        following statements is true? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. Voice frames are always transmitted before lower-priority frames.
        
        B. The category that is used to take control of the transmission is known as the primary access category.
        
        C. If a lower category frame is transmitted, only higher category frames can be transmitted  using the other spatial streams.
        
        D. Lower category frames can be transmitted as long as they do not increase the transmission duration of the primary access category.
        
        E. Multiple lower category frames can be transmitted along
        with the primary access category frame.

        *答案解析*

        B, D and E. The AP will initiate a transmission from whichever
        access category is next in line. This is known as the primary
        access category, and all others are known as secondary access
        categories. The AP can transmit additional frames (one or
        more) from primary or secondary access categories, providing
        that the frames are shorter than the primary frame. 

    15. Name some of the factors that a modulation and coding scheme
        (MCS) uses to define data rates for a VHT radio? (Choose all
        that apply.)

        A. Modulation method

        B. Equal/unequal modulation

        C. Number of spatial streams

        D. GI

        E. Channel size

        F. Code rate

        *答案解析*

        A and F. VHT radios use modulation and coding schemes to
        define data rates based on modulation and code rate. This is
        different from HT radios that used modulation type, the number
        of spatial streams, channel size, guard interval,
        equal/unequal modulation, and other factors. 

    16. Which of these capabilities are considered mandatory for a
        phase one 802.11ac access point as defined by the Wi-Fi
        Alliance’s vendor certification program called Wi-Fi
        CERTIFIED ac? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. 20, 40, 80, 160 MHz channel

        B. MCS 0–7

        C. MCS 0–8

        D. Two spatial streams

        E. Long guard interval

        *答案解析*

        B, D and E. Wi-Fi CERTIFIED ac access points require 20, 40,
        and 80 MHz channel widths, MCS 0-7, two spatial streams, and
        800 nanosecond long guard interval. 

    17. VHT radios are backward compatible with which of the following
        type of 802.11 technology? (Choose all that apply.)

        A. Clause 17 radios (HR-DSSS)

        B. Clause 18 radios (OFDM)

        C. Clause 14 radios (FHSS)

        D. Clause 19 radios (ERP)

        E. Clause 20 radios (HT)

        *答案解析*

        and E. VHT radios are backward compatible with all previous 5
        GHz compliant radios. This include 802.11a (OFDM) radios and 5
        GHz 802.11n (HT) radios. 

    18. Which of the following statements is not true regarding the
        number of subcarriers in the following channels? (Choose all
        that apply.)

        A. 40 MHz subcarriers = 2 times 20 MHz subcarriers

        B. 40 MHz subcarriers > 2 times 20 MHz subcarriers

        C. 80 MHz subcarriers = 2 times 40 MHz subcarriers

        D. 80 MHz subcarriers > 2 times 40 MHz subcarriers

        E. 160 MHz subcarriers = 2 times 80 MHz subcarriers

        F. 160 MHz subcarriers > 2 times 80 MHz subcarriers

        *答案解析*

        B, D and F. A 20 MHz channel uses 64 subcarriers. A 40 MHz
        channel uses 128 subcarriers. An 80 MHz channel uses 256
        subcarriers. A 160 MHz channel is made of two 80 MHz channels
        that can be either side by side or separated from each
        other. The number of subcarriers in a 160 MHz channel is
        exactly two times the number of 80 MHz subcarriers, 512 subcarriers.

    19. The 802.11ac amendment defines a maximum of how many spatial
        streams for client? 

        A. One spatial stream

        B. Two spatial streams

        C. Four spatial streams

        D. Eight spatial streams

        *答案解析*

        C. The amendment defines a maximum of four spatial streams for
        a client and eight for an AP.

    20. Which 802.11ac technology is the most revolutionary?

        A. 80 MHz and 160 MHz channel widths

        B. A-MPDU for all frames

        C. 256-QAM modulation

        D. 5 GHz only frequencies

        E. MU-MIMO

        F. Explicit beamforming

        *答案解析*

        E. MU-MIMO is the most revolutionary technology. 802.11 APs
        will now be able to transmit to multiple client stations at
        the same time. 80 MHz and 160 MHz channels are an expansion of
        the 40 MHz bonded channel introduced in 802.11n.
